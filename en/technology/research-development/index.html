        <p class="_mt20">Epson has always provided value by examining ways it can use its efficient, compact, and
          precision technologies to benefit society. Under Epson 25 Renewed, however, we are taking a different
          approach. Now, we always start with societal issues, analyze what kind of technology is needed to solve them,
          and then develop that technology.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">To shift to this approach, we had to objectively evaluate our capabilities to reveal the gap
          between where we are and where we want to be (our aspirational goal). We are working to close this gap by
          mapping out a technology development path, while also taking into account societal issues and business
          viability.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Epson will try to achieve sustainability and enrich communities by boldly taking on challenges
          with new ideas and new methods.</p>

          <h2>Technology Development Strategy<br>
            <span class="fsS">- Advance basic, core, and product technologies that support innovation<br>
              Strengthen material, AI, and digital technologies to create both product and experience value</span>
          </h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">We have defined four material issues ("materialities") in Epson 25 Renewed based on societal
          issues. In technology development we are focusing on three of them. First, to achieve sustainability in a
          circular economy, we are focusing on developing technology to become carbon negative and close the resource
          loop, primarily by developing materials to free us from reliance on underground resources. Second, to advance
          the frontiers of industry, we will transform manufacturing by providing solutions such as automated equipment
          that saves energy and space and accurately performs complicated tasks that require precision. Third, to
          improve the quality of life, we will enable all to enjoy a healthy and satisfying life by using AI and digital
          technology to connect all people to information captured by sensors. Our role in solving these material issues
          is to contribute technology. Core and product technologies are derived from base technologies and these, in
          turn, underlie each business and drive innovation.</p>

            alt="Technology Development Strategy">
        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20">We must thus continuously advance our base, core, and product technologies, and want to
          particularly strengthen materials, AI, and digital technologies. Materials will significantly contribute to
          the environmental business. We will focus on developing plastic-free technology that uses the defibration
          technology utilized in the PaperLab and on developing highly functional, more eco-considerate metal powders.
          AI and digital technology are essential in accelerating the shift from products to experiences.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">We will strengthen algorithms and AI technologies for converting data extracted from Epson
          products into customer value. The environment, digital transformation (DX), and co-creation are priorities for
          realizing Epson 25 Renewed, but co-creation is also an important factor in technology development. Considering
          business only in the context of your own technology will end up confining you to a narrow area and limit your
          speed. Epson does not have everything that is required to solve societal issues. The idea of Epson 25 Renewed
          is to create new value with partners who understand and share our desire to make the world a better place.
          Epson has long been a vertically integrated company and has had a strong tendency to go it alone rather than
          partner with others. However, with the world changing so rapidly due to COVID-19 and digitalization, we
          recognize that co-creation will allow us to make better proposals, faster.</p>

        <div class="heading02">
          <h2>Elevating the Quality of Development via Front-Loading</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">Conventionally, we developed technology by starting out small and gradually moving forward as
          we cleared issues. This approach will change. The disadvantage of the conventional approach is that it takes
          time but also that, even if serious issues are discovered at a later stage, it's hard to go back. From now on,
          therefore, we will front-load development, with knowledgeable people from all functions participating from the
          start of development (the trial-and-error stage) and verifying quality at each subsequent stage.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">When formulating Epson 25 Renewed, we felt we needed to improve tactics and scenario precision.
          By front-loading development to speed up the problem-solving cycle and increase the quality of development, we
          will speed up productization and commercialization.</p>
