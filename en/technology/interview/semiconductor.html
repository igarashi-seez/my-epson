            <p>Epson's semiconductor business has developed original device technology that drives primarily from the
              efficient, compact, and precision technologies that Epson initially developed for wristwatch
              semiconductors. The semiconductor business provides chips for use in Epson's finished products, thus
              increasing their value. The company also applies this technology to support outside
              customers.<br />Epson's semiconductor business has many different technologies and products, including
              semiconductors for in-vehicle applications. We interviewed a senior engineer involved in the development
              of ICs for these latter systems about product features, future prospects, and his thoughts on development.

          <h3>Many people associate Epson with printers, so how did Epson get involved in semiconductor technology
            development and product development?</h3>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Yamada</span>Epson's history in semiconductor development is closely
          tied to watch development. This is because it was essential to incorporate semiconductor technology into
          watches to reduce power consumption, make them smaller, and stabilize crystal oscillation to commercialize the
          world's first quartz watch. Since then, we have been developing semiconductors to support Epson's finished
          products, such as LCDs, printers, scanners, projectors, and robots. Epson's strengths as a manufacturer lie in
          what we call our efficient, compact and precision technologies, and we seek to make Epson semiconductors the
          foundation of this technology.</p>
        <p>In addition to semiconductor circuits for internal customers, we also sell crystal oscillators, MCUs, LCD
          drivers, LCD controllers, USB communications ICs and other semiconductor products to external customers. An
          Epson semiconductor may even be inside a product you are using.</p>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Yamada</span>I develop semiconductor products for in-vehicle
          applications. Recently, we are working on the development of semiconductors for power control such as motors
          and solenoids for automobiles.</p>
        <p>The technology in this area is completely different from that in Epson's traditional area of expertise, which
          concerns low-power technology that limits leaks and drive currents. We must simultaneously achieve both large,
          ampere-level current control and highly accurate detection on the millivolt level. The semiconductor
          technology used has shifted from CMOS for low power consumption to DMOS for power. The circuit technology is
          also different from ones in which we had expertise. We now use the circuit technology in large current
          drivers, high-precision amplifiers, and other circuits. Furthermore, semiconductors used in vehicle
          applications must operate in a wide range of environmental temperatures, be resistant to electrostatic, meet
          EMC requirements, and satisfy stringent reliability and other quality requirements.</p>
        <p>We work closely with automotive customers from the product development stage, and people from our planning,
          design, inspection, and assembly groups carefully review products to ensure that they meet high quality
          requirements. I think that providing quality from the product design level is a feature of Epson products.</p>
        <p>Looking back, we developed DMOS technology for automotive products by using technology that we developed to
          create value for Epson printers. Various development programs that were conducted in close cooperation with
          our customers form the basis of our technology as well as the foundation for evolution.</p>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>What were some of the difficulties you faced in developing semiconductors for vehicles?</h3>
        </div>

        <figure class="_center">

        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Yamada</span>One of the most difficult issues we faced in developing
          semiconductors for motor power control and the like was dealing with a problem called "negative surge."</p>
        <p class="_mt20">In the past, Epson used low power consumption as a weapon in product development. However, when
          we began to control large currents, we began to clearly see a physical phenomenon that we had never
          encountered before: negative surges proportional to the current ratio (10<sup>6</sup> to 10<sup>9</sup>
          times). To explain in a little more technical detail, a negative surge is a phenomenon in which a negative
          potential is transiently generated by the parasitic inductor component of the wiring when a large current is
          passed through the wiring to control switching. This was a major issue because it could lead, in the worst
          case scenario, to damage to the terminal structure of existing semiconductors.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">The effort to solve the problem involved a large number of design engineers and process
          engineers of all ages. It took nearly a year of study and spirited debate to arrive at a solution. After
          examining various ideas and repeated trial production, we were finally able to solve the negative surge
          problem by developing and improving the circuit scheme and device structure.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">In retrospect, this was a huge challenge, but we learned a lot, including from our failures in
          the trial production process, and we were able to incorporate this knowledge into verification tools and
          circuit and layout design methods. Taking on a new challenge improved our technical capabilities and
          knowledge, but more than anything, I feel that we suceeded in terms of teamwork.</p>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Yamada</span>As semiconductor professionals, we listen carefully to
          what customers want and can propose the best solutions from the semiconductor device level. I think that is
          the strength of Epson semiconductors. To give you one example, a certain vehicle power control IC customer
          requested a product for advanced motor control and parameter storage. We responded to this request by
          proposing a new semiconductor process that incorporates extremely fine logic and non-volatile memory in the
          conventional DMOS process and creating a product. So, not only do we simply provide semiconductor products, we
          also closely engage customers to gain a deep understanding of their problems, specifications, and technical
          requirements so that we can recommend the best technology and products to solve their problems. Moving
          forward, we want to further strengthen these activities so that we can use our semiconductor technology and
          products to contribute even more to our customers' success.</p>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Yamada</span>From the very beginning, Epson's semiconductor business
          has always tried to deliver value to customers by working closely with them to understand the needs of their
          finished products. Semiconductors do not function on their own; they only have value when they are used by
          customers. As semiconductor engineers, we work closely with customers to understand and solve their problems,
          expand into new fields, deepen our knowledge, and make useful proposals. This is our mission, and we will
          continue to harness Epson's collective strength to create customer value through circuit development but also
          through processes and packaging.</p>
