        <p class="_mt20">Epson's mechanical watches in the ORIENT line boast a history that traces back to 1950. In
          1951, the company announced the first ORIENT STAR watch model. This was followed by many more models and
          technological innovations over the ensuing 70 years. Masashi Takano and Keiichi Mukaiyama, two of the people
          who have had a hand in these innovations, were asked about the development of ORIENT and ORIENT STAR products,
          as well as about the story behind the development of technology for the 46-F8 series calibers installed in the
          latest models.</p>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Takano</span>ORIENT Watch Co., Ltd. produced the first ORIENT watch
          more than 70 years ago, in 1950. I wasn't involved in that, but I have read and heard from those who were
          that, after the announcement of the first model, they picked up the pace of technology development and that
          this work culminated in the development of the T-type, N-type, and L-type movements by the end of the 1960s.
        </p>
        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Mukaiyama</span>Then, in 1971, the 46 series calibers, which are used
          in many current ORIENT and ORIENT STAR watches, were developed. These movements have a so-called magic lever
          that Epson developed to provide high winding efficiency. They were engineered with simple mechanisms that
          enabled them to be used in many subsequent models.</p>
        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Takano</span>-On the other hand, the development of the 46 series
          calibers was followed, in the 1980s, by a rise in popularity of quartz watches. Technological progress not
          only on ORIENT watches but on nearly all other domestic mechanical watches stalled as a result. In fact, most
          mechanical watches were sold overseas, particularly in regions where batteries were not readily available.</p>
        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Mukaiyama</span>So, it sounds bad, but I think it's accurate to say
          that we just quietly kept making mechanical watches. The simplicity of the 46 series calibers earned them
          favor because they were easy to maintain and could be used in many different models. However, the fact that we
          continued to quietly make the same movements for nearly 20 years is what rekindled later technological
          innovation of ORIENT watches, including the latest movement, the 46-F8.</p>
        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Takano</span>The situation completely changed in the 1990s. Swiss
          luxury mechanical watches began attracting renewed attention, and as this wave of interest increased, eyes
          also started turning toward ORIENT watches. This resulted in the release of many new models with newly
          developed mechanisms like a power reserve indicator, which indicates how much energy the mainspring has left,
          and a retrograde function, which indicates the day of the week with a hand that bounces backwards at the end
          of a week instead of going full circle.</p>

        <figure class="_center _mt30">
          <img src="/en/technology/interview/img/img_mukaiyama_002.jpg" width="720" height="480"
            alt="Mukaiyama Keiichi">
        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Mukaiyama</span>In the 2010s, a project to develop a new movement,
          which came to be called the 46-F6, was launched. The 46-series was developed in 1971, so the 46-F6 would be
          the first major movement innovation in about 40 years. The new movement was redesigned with a standardized
          main plate, bridges, and other parts so that these parts no longer had to be changed for each model. The
          production system was also overhauled.</p>
        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Takano</span> One of the most difficult challenges was to create
          movements both with and without a power reserve indicator using the same parts. And we were confronted with
          more than just technical issues. We also had to manufacture products while we were developing the new
          movement, so we had to closely analyze sales and find the right time to use the production lines for trial
          manufacturing of the new movement. Ultimately, the development of the 46-F6 turned into a two-year project.
        </p>
        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Mukaiyama</span>The next model, the 46-F7, was released in 2017 and
          would offer improved accuracy and a longer power reserve, boosting it from 40 to 50 hours. We also decorated
          the movements with sharper patterns by engraving them with cutters instead of rubber whetstones. It was around
          this time that we also researched and developed an important part called the escape wheel.</p>

        <div class="heading02">
          <h2>The escape wheel was made from silicon instead of metal to increase its accuracy and reduce its weight.
          </h2>
        </div>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>What is the purpose of the escape wheel?</h3>
        </div>

        <figure class="_center">
          <img src="/en/technology/interview/img/img_takano_003.jpg" width="720" height="480" alt="Takano Masashi">
        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Takano</span>In a nutshell, it's one of the most important parts in
          terms of keeping accurate time. Mechanical watches are generally made up of more than 100 exquisitely crafted
          parts. Each of these parts moves precisely to keep accurate time. A mainspring like that used in old wind-up
          toys serves as the power source. The mainspring is wound up, and the energy generated when the wound energy is
          released is used as the power source.</p>
        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Mukaiyama</span>Energy is first transmitted to the gear train, which
          barrel complete (first wheel), center wheel, third wheel, and fourth wheel. The center wheel is attached to
          the minute hand, and the fourth wheel is attached to the second hand. These hands make one complete circle
          every 60 minutes or 60 seconds, respectively. This is the point where things get important. At the end of the
          wheel train is an escape wheel, followed by a pallet fork, a balance wheel, and a hairspring, which is one of
          the components of the balance wheel. These parts make up mechanisms called the escapement and controller unit.
          In other words, the escape wheel is not only the last wheel in the gear train but is also a part that makes up
          the escapement.</p>
        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Takano</span>The role of the escape wheel is to gradually use the
          energy of the mainspring instead of allowing it to be released all at once. It's the movement of the escape
          wheel that literally ticks off the accurate time. You can imagine it as the escape wheel, pallet fork, and
          balance wheel reproducing the movement of a pendulum clock.</p>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>What did the research and development of the escape wheel entail, specifically?</h3>
        </div>

        <figure class="_center">
          <img src="/en/technology/interview/img/img_mukaiyama_003.jpg" width="720" height="480" alt="escape wheel">
        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Mukaiyama</span>Broadly speaking, there were two main themes. One was
          to further increase the drive time. The other was to improve the accuracy of the escape wheel.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">To increase the drive time, we needed to reduce the power loss of the escapement, which
          consumed about half of the energy obtained from the mainspring.</p>
        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Takano</span> There are several reasons why the escapement consumes
          half of the power, but one of them is weight. In the movements up to the 46-F7, the escape wheel was made of a
          metal called nickel silver. The escape wheel was thus heavy and used up power to move.</p>
        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Takano</span> Frictional force between the pallet stones and escape
          wheel was another source of power consumption. Pallet stones are installed at the tips of the pallet fork,
          which connects the escape wheel and balance wheel. The pallet stones are made from synthetic rubies, which are
          durable enough to withstand long hours of driving. If the amount of engagement between the pallet stones and
          the escape wheel was the conventional processing accuracy of one one-hundredth of a millimeter, a certain
          margin, which we call the amount of clearance, would have to be provided in the design. Naturally, that
          clearance became an extra load, which also generated frictional force that was expended by the pallet stones
          and the escape wheel. Therefore, in order to solve the problems of weight and dimensional accuracy, we decided
          to begin developing a silicon escape wheel, something with which we had no prior experience.</p>

          <h3>Is a silicon escape wheel common in watches?</h3>
        </div>

        <figure class="_center">

        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Mukaiyama</span>Some Swiss watchmakers use silicon escape wheels, but
          I think we were the first in Japan to attempt their manufacture. However, the Watch Operations Division did
          not have the capability to make silicon parts. Therefore, we sought the cooperation of Epson's Technology
          Development Division, which we knew had silicon processing expertise. We worked with them to develop a silicon
          escape wheel by using the MEMS fabrication technology that is also used to manufacture components such as
          Epson's printheads.</p>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>Where did you run into difficulty in development?</h3>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Takano</span>Silicon has a low relative density-about one-third that
          of the nickel silver we used for metal escape wheels. Since it is a glass-like material, it is brittle and
          easily chipped. So, one of the biggest technological challenges was to make the escape wheel lighter while
          still maintaining the required strength. The solution was a film.</p>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>A film?</h3>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Mukaiyama</span>When silicon is thermally annealed, a silicon-dioxide
          film forms on the surface. This film is removed and then again thermal oxidation is performed. We found that
          when this process is repeated, the silicon surface becomes rounded, corners are removed, and a silicon-dioxide
          layer forms on the surface. The changes reduce the brittleness and susceptibility to chipping. As a result, we
          succeeded in making an escape wheel that is even stronger than a metal escape wheel.</p>
        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Takano</span>MEMS fabrication increased processing accuracy to one
          one-thousandth of a millimeter. As a result, we were able to reduce the amount of engagement by 80%.
          Furthermore, switching from nickel silver to silicon reduced the weight of the escape wheel by around 65%.
          However, there was another issue that also needed to be addressed.</p>

        <div class="heading02">
          <h2>New patented technology was acquired through R&D on silicon escape wheels.</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>What kind of issue?</h3>
        </div>

        <figure class="_center">
          <img src="/en/technology/interview/img/img_mukaiyama_005.jpg" width="720" height="480"
            alt="Mukaiyama Keiichi">
        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Mukaiyama</span>There was an issue caused by the susceptibility of
          silicon to chipping. It became necessary to adjust the pinion that is inserted in the center of the escape
          wheel. The pinion, like the earlier metal escape wheels, is made of metal, so it could be forcefully tapped
          into place.</p>
        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Takano</span>However, when we tried to secure a silicon escape wheel
          with a metal pinion, the escape wheel broke. Conversely, if you don't use as much force, the pinion will not
          be able to hold the escape wheel properly and accuracy will deteriorate. So, we mulled over potential
          solutions. The idea we came up with was to disperse the force and prevent breaking by lending springiness with
          the configuration of the escape wheel.</p>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>That was an innovative idea.</h3>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Mukaiyama</span>However, we had to determine what configuration would
          actually be best. The idea was good, but the journey from there to actually designing an escape wheel with a
          configuration that would actually resist breaking was not so easy. In addition to reviewing ideas with people
          in the Technology Development Division, we made dozens of escape wheel prototypes in our search for the
          optimum configuration. We arrived at the current configuration through this process of trial and error.</p>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>It is a unique configuration.</h3>
        </div>

        <figure class="_center">
          <img src="/en/technology/interview/img/img_takano_004.jpg" width="720" height="480" alt="Takano Masashi">
        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Takano</span>The escape wheel was made springy in places by designing
          it with windmill-like vanes. In addition, the configuration of the part of the escape wheel that is in close
          contact with the pinion is like the tip of the bristles on a toothbrush. The pinion was also redesigned and
          slits were added so that the pinion would mesh with this uneven configuration. This process of trial and error
          resulted in a new escape wheel and pinion that disperse force as they mesh. This design is also patented.</p>

        <div class="heading03">

        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Mukaiyama</span>We did. Here, too, the Technology Development
          Division's nano-level film thickness control technology played an important role. In addition to the oxide
          layer mentioned earlier, multiple layers of polysilicon film were also formed for more vivid color
          development. The result is a bright blue escape wheel. Incidentally, the reason we made it blue was that the
          shape of the escape wheel resembled a galaxy and the blue was reminiscent of the Milky Way.</p>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Takano</span>Now that I think back on it, honestly, we struggled a
          lot during the development stage. But, after overcoming all the hardships, the first time I saw the blue
          escape wheel precisely rotating, I couldn't help but be impressed. The ORIENT STAR models equipped with the
          46-F8 movement have a skeleton design, so I hope that people will experience the thrill that we felt when we
          first saw the movement through the crystals on the front and back of the watches.</p>
