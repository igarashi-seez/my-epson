          <h2>Color Control Technology: Faithfully reproducing colors</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">Epson's Color Control Technology is an image processing technology that faithfully reproduces
          the colors the customer desires. It has five components: color separation, color profiling, color
          transformation, color optimization, and color prediction. The technology contributes to the high-quality
          printing for which Epson is renowned. It enables the printer to produce the desired colors quickly and
          accurately for a wide range of media, including photo proofing, signage, and textiles.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">We interviewed Hirokazu Nunokawa and Kenji Matsuzaka, both of whom were involved in the
          development of Epson's raster image processor (RIP) software for industrial printing. This software was a
          first for Epson, which primarily produces hardware. We asked Nunokawa and Matsuzaka about what inspired the
          development of the software, what breakthroughs it yielded, and aboutthe future outlook.</p>

          <h3>Why did you start working on Epson's Color Control Technology?</h3>
        </div>

        <figure class="_mt20 _center">
          <img src="/en/technology/interview/img/img_fukawa_002.jpg" width="720" height="480" alt="Hirokazu Nunokawa">
        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Nunokawa</span>By 2012, Epson had developed high-precision printing
          technology in its photographic printing business. Epson wanted to expand the customer base for this
          technology, so we entered the B2B market, targeting commercial and industrial applications. We believed in the
          potential of Epson's Micro Piezo technology. As a heat-free technology, it was compatible with many different
          inks, including solvent and resin inks.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">But to be honest, we had underestimated the challenge. Epson had earned a strong reputation for
          image quality in the photo proofing market, so we assumed that commercial and industrial customers would also
          appreciate our products. However, initial reactions were not what we had hoped for.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">We had failed to appreciate that the needs of the commercial and industrial markets, where
          print media is the product, differed from those of the photo proofing market. In the photo proofing business,
          the standard practice is for the printer manufacturer to supply the specialty media and for in-house
          technicians to configure the printing conditions. In signage, however, it's the customer that determines the
          image quality. The customer's specifications will depend on the intended use and type of physical media (such
          as an outdoor sign, a shop window display, a hanging banner, or wallpaper). Epson's printers offered precision
          and accuracy, but there was a trade-off: a complicated configuration process. Consequently, customers
          complained that it took too long to configure the necessary printing conditions for their designs, which in
          some cases involved reproducing gradations or matching color tones between multiple printers.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Accordingly, we spent around two years visiting customers in Asia and the USA, and listening to
          their requests and complaints. Based on this feedback, we concluded that we should develop our own raster
          image processor (RIP) software. We then started work on the image processing technology that would underlie
          this product.</p>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>At the time, printing businesses typically used third-party RIP software (RIP software developed by an
            independent software vendor).<br>
            Why did you conclude that you needed your own RIP software?</h3>
        </div>

        <figure class="_mt20 _center">

        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Matsuzaka</span>We had an eye-opening moment after visiting a major
          printing client in Taiwan. The experience became a turning point in our strategy to develop image processing
          technology. The client had no doubt at all that Epson's image quality was superior to that of our competitors
          and recognized our potential. A much more important factor to the client-the factor that was critical in the
          competition-was the matter of what third-party RIP software would be selected to run our printers.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">The client needed specialist technicians who could configure Epson's printers to the optimum
          specs. It was the skill of these technicians that would differentiate Epson from the competition. We had never
          considered this a goal. Our goal until then was to provide a high image quality printing experience to every
          user around the world. However, our experience in Taiwan taught us that we could only achieve this mission if
          we developed our own RIP software.</p>

        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Nunokawa</span>Our department drafted a theme-oriented roadmap and a
          team of five started working on it. Epson's Color Control Technology would ultimately consist of five
          components: color separation, color profiling, color transformation, color optimization, and color prediction.
        </p>
        <p class="_mt20">We started on the first component, color separation. Our main focus for this component was how
          to reproduce color gradation. In 2014, we moved to color profiling, which involved clearly delineating the
          colors that the printer could reproduce. Next was color transformation, which involved converting monitor
          colors to print colors quickly and accurately. For this task, we used an ICC profile (color data based on the
          standards of the International Color Consortium) that we had developed during the profiling step. With these
          three components completed, we could significantly reduce the time and effort that customers in the signage
          business had to spend in tailoring the colors to the media and configuring the printing conditions.
          Consequently, we received many positive customer reviews.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Then came the next challenge: meeting the needs of the dye-sublimation transfer printing
          market. These businesses had needs that differed widely from those in the signage market. For example, they
          required consistent color reproduction for repeat orders, and the colors needed to match their materials
          specified by their client. To meet these needs, we worked on the two remaining components, color prediction
          and color optimization. We released these components in 2016. Finally, in 2018, we publicly released the full
          set of Color Control Technology.</p>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>What technical breakthroughs did Color Control Technology yield?</h3>
        </div>

        <figure class="_mt20 _center">
          <img src="/en/technology/interview/img/img_matsusaka_003.jpg" width="720" height="480" alt="Kenji Matsuzaka">
        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Matsuzaka</span>Previously, customers in the dye-sublimation transfer
          printing businesses would spend a week configuring the colors. Thanks to the color prediction and color
          optimization components, they can now accomplish this task in just half a day.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">With sportswear, for example, you must reproduce colors very accurately and consistently. After
          all, sport fans want the color of their uniforms to match the uniforms worn by their team. What makes this
          task challenging is that the dye-sublimation transfer printing makers traditionally rely on seasoned experts
          to check the color consistency with the naked eye. This practice forces printing businesses to spend a long
          time readjusting the colors again and again. A further problem is that the final color configuration is
          usually unique to each printer model. In other words, once the color is settled, you can only reproduce it
          using the same model. Eventually, the model in question will go out of production. That means you need a large
          stock of spare parts so that you can continue reproducing the colors on what would now be an obsolete machine.
        </p>
        <p class="_mt20">Our color control technology significantly reduces the time and effort associated with the
          color configuration process. It also allows the user to reproduce the same color regardless of the printer
          model or target material. The technology is a boon to dye-sublimation transfer businesses, as they no longer
          need to stick with an old printer model.</p>
        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Nunokawa</span>When a customer buys a new printer model, they can use
          Epson's color technology to analyze the color data and printing attributes of their previous printer. In this
          way, they can start reproducing the same colors on the new printer within the same day. We have seen a growing
          number of cases in which a customer witnesses this amazing technology first-hand and then buys Epson products.
