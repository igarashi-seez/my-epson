            <p>Epson's inkjet printheads enable fast, high image quality printing thanks to their superb ink-ejection
              performance, compatibility, and durability. Particularly impressive is PrecisionCore, which prints even
              faster and with even greater image quality. PrecisionCore achieves this feat by making full use of Epson's
              proprietary Micro Piezo technology and microelectro-mechanical systems (MEMS).</p>
            <p>We interviewed Shunsuke Watanabe, who played a leading role in developing PrecisionCore. We talked about
              what makes this printhead so special and about its potential to serve in a wide range of applications
              across different business fields. We also discussed the inspiration behind the project and the project's
              future outlook.</p>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>What's makes Epson's inkjet printheads so effective?</h3>
        </div>

        <figure class="_mt20 _center">
          <img src="/en/technology/interview/img/img_watanabe_003.jpg" width="720" height="480" alt="Shunsuke Watanabe">
        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Watanabe</span>Epson's inkjet printheads are piezoelectric. They use
          Epson's proprietary Micro Piezo technology to achieve superb ink ejection performance, compatibility, and
          durability.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">With piezoelectric printing, you can eject the ink quickly and accurately. Piezoelectric
          elements change shape when a voltage is applied. Utilizing this phenomenon, you can apply a voltage to the
          elements to generate mechanical pressure and squeeze tiny droplets of ink out from nozzles. The piezoelectric
          elements must produce a high level of displacement to eject the necessary amount of ink. Therefore, the
          performance of a piezoelectric inkjet rests entirely upon the performance of the elements. If the printer has
          more nozzles, it will print at a higher resolution and speed. But if you want to make an inkjet with lots of
          high-res nozzles, your piezoelectric elements must produce a very high level of displacement. To meet this
          requirement, PrecisionCore printheads use Epson's Thin-Film Piezo (TFP) technology. The thinner a
          piezoelectric element is, the more it will deform when a given voltage is applied. But there is an issue:
          thinner piezoelectric elements are more fragile. Their fragility makes thin piezoelectric elements harder to
          produce and less durable. Fortunately, however, Epson had the technological clout to become the first in the
          industry to produce ultra-thin, high-displacement, highly reliable piezoelectric elements at high volume.</p>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>What advantages do PrecisionCore printheads offer?</h3>
        </div>


        <div class="row df clearfix _mb30">
          <div class="grid6 _mb20">
            <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Watanabe</span>First, although PrecisionCore printheads are
              small, they have many more nozzles compared to conventional printheads. With more nozzles, the printheads
              eject more ink, enabling faster, higher image quality printing. Another major advantage lies in the
              scalability of PrecisionCore's print chips. These tiny chips are modular. That means you can easily
              arrange them in various configurations to suit different kinds of printheads.</p>
            <p class="_mt20">I should also mention Epson's proprietary microelectro-mechanical systems (MEMS). The MEMS
              has enabled us to process the printhead's nozzles uniformly, minimizing variations in size and alignment.
              With uniform nozzles, the printheads eject ink accurately, resulting in photorealistic prints.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="grid6 _mb20">

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>When you standardize the production of a product (as you would for microchips or memory chips, say),
          competitors can imitate you. However, Epson's TFPs and high-res nozzles are inimitable. These products embody
          our proprietary technology, which itself is the culmination of many years of painstaking research and
          development, from the design of materials to the minute production specifications. In other words, only Epson
          can produce these products. Epson derives its strength from the technological ability to produce such
          high-precision products in a stable, uniform manner.</p>

        <div class="heading02">
          <h2>Young leaders drive innovation</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>What was the inspiration behind PrecisionCore?</h3>
        </div>

        <figure class="_mt20 _center">
          <img src="/en/technology/interview/img/img_watanabe_005.jpg" width="720" height="480" alt="Shunsuke Watanabe">
        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Watanabe</span>By the turn of the century, Epson' printing business
          had progressed significantly in consumer markets. Epson was looking to expand into a range of business
          markets, from offices to industrial applications. To that end, Minoru Usui (then President and Representative
          Director, now Chairman) issued a major directive to develop a printhead compatible with all printing markets.
          Accordingly, we started work on a new printhead that would raise the level of our core technology. That
          printhead was PrecisionCore MicroTFP. The ultimate purpose of the project was to take inkjet printing to the
          next level and forge new, broader business segments.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">The person who managed the project at the time told us that we could only evolve
          technologically if we demolished our existing technology (in a good sense) and reassembled it. To that end, he
          said, young engineers needed to engage actively and bring fresh ideas. He assembled a group of young leaders
          aged around 30. Once these young engineers took charge, the project to develop PrecisionCore MicroTFP went
          into lightspeed.</p>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>What challenges did you face in developing PrecisionCore printheads?</h3>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Watanabe</span>The toughest challenge was to upgrade performance
          while also reducing size. We started to strip away all the redundant elements in the nozzles, ink channels,
          actuators, electronics, and so forth. From corner to corner, we removed everything unnecessary. Everyone, from
          designers to production engineers, played their part to satisfy all the task requirements, accepting no
          compromise. Time constraints made the project all the more challenging. In just a short space of time, we had
          to identify the steps toward the goal and envisage not just how the finished product would look but how it
          would be produced.</p>

        <div class="heading02">
          <h2>Going further with open innovation</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>Will there be even more applications for inkjet printing in the future?</h3>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Watanabe</span>Our inkjet printheads already serve in a wide range of
          fields. In addition to consumer use, the printheads serve in offices and in industrial applications such as
          signage, posters, and labeling. For each of these applications, we are working to further upgrade print
          quality and speed. Additionally, we offer these markets solutions that are more eco-friendly. Many
          conventional printers are not kind to the environment because, among other things, they produce waste fluid.
          By contrast, our inkjet printers use no more ink than is necessary. This no-waste technology reduces the
          printer's carbon footprint. Thus, by encouraging these markets to switch from analog to digital printing, we
          can promote a less wasteful, more energy-efficient form of printing for small-lot production.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Besides this, there remain many untapped possibilities. Epson's inkjet tech, with its ability
          to accurately place tiny ink droplets without contact, offers a digital solution to printing companies with
          cutting-edge large-volume printers. It can also help revolutionize printed electronics (such as printed
          circuits and microstrip antennas) and bioprinting.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">As part of our effort to capture these new opportunities, we opened the Fujimi Inkjet
          Innovation Lab in 2019. This lab runs ejection testing using devices fitted with Epson's inkjet printheads. In
          this way, we explore many different potential applications. The lab is a collaborative venture. We invite our
          partners to visit the lab and collaborate with us in creating new markets and services. Our mission is to come
          up with not one or two, but 10 or 20 new ideas for manufacturing processes.</p>

            <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Watanabe</span>I'm excited about all the possibilities that still
              lie ahead. As Epson's inkjet technology continues to evolve, and as we continue collaborating with
              partners, you will see the emergence of many more applications. To give some everyday examples, printing
              is now used for textiles (t-shirts and other clothing), wallpaper, faux woodgrain finish for desks,
              exterior wall design, cardboard packaging for home deliveries, and edible souvenirs. In business and
              industry, printing is used for circuit boards, shop displays, and biotesting. As these examples
              illustrate, our inkjet technology can potentially meet a whole host of needs. To give these ideas shape,
              we'll keep working on innovative challenges in collaboration with a broad range of partners, never giving
              up until we reach the goal. If you have an innovative idea, if you think something could be done better,
              or if you want to try something new, we'd love to hear from you. Let's work together to make your idea a
              reality.</p>
            <p class="_mt20">Epson certainly welcomes new challenges, as they bring opportunities for further growth.
              Ink and printhead technology still has plenty of scope to become more advanced. I want Epson to keep
              pushing the technological envelope so that, in five or ten years from now, the technology will have
              changed beyond recognition and be doing things we never thought possible. We have no-waste
              technology-technology that ensures that the printhead ejects no more ink than is necessary. We also have
              technology that saves energy in printing and production processes, and technology that ejects ink onto
              many kinds of materials without contact. If we use these technologies to the full, then we can both offer
              better value to the customer and solve societal and environmental issues, thus contributing to a brighter,
              more sustainable future.</p>
