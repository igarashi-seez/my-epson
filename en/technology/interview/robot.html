          <h2>Epson innovation: Integrating robotics with sensing technology</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">Epson's robotics business once focused on automating the assembly of Epson watches. Nowadays,
          it engages in the manufacturing of electronic products such as mobile phones and other small precision
          instruments. Robots must assemble the tiny components of such products with minute precision, as the slightest
          vibration or misalignment will directly affect the quality of the product. To solve this challenge, Epson has
          integrated robotics with its original sensing technology to create robots that achieve excellent locomotive
          performance and are easy to control. Thanks to these robots, operations that once relied on manual labor and
          human senses can now be automated, resulting in better precision and speed.</p>
        <p>We interviewed two robotics engineers about the advantages and applications of robotics. We also discussed
          the circumstances in which they developed the gyroscopic sensors and force sensors used to control the robots.

          <h3>What are the advantages of Epson's robotics?</h3>
        </div>

        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Motoyoshi</span>Initially, Epson designed robots to automate the
          process of assembling watches. In this respect, our robotics technology had different origins from than that
          of other manufacturers. Most manufacturers introduced industrial robots to lift payloads that were too heavy
          for humans or to perform operations that would be hazardous to human health. In Epson's case, the focus was
          always on speed and precision. Our robots were initially designed for high-precision tasks that had previously
          relied on human senses. Subsequently, we achieved a huge leap in robotic performance by equipping the robots
          with gyroscopic sensors and force sensors. We developed these sensors using Epson's original quartz crystal
          devices.</p>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>Tell us about the circumstances in which you came to develop the gyroscopic sensor-based control
            technology and force sensors. What challenges did you face?</h3>
        </div>

        <figure class="_center">
          <img src="/en/technology/interview/img/img_motoyoshi_003.jpg" width="720" height="480" alt="Masaki Motoyoshi">
        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Motoyoshi</span>Epson has always prided itself in speed and
          precision. To improve speed and precision, you must do more to suppress vibration. The conventional method for
          controlling robots involves the use of a servomotor to provide feedback on the angular position of robotics
          joints. The problem with this method is that even if all the motors are aligned correctly, the robotic arm can
          still get contorted, causing the tip of the arm to vibrate or deviate from its target position. To solve this
          problem, we started using gyroscopic sensors to detect vibrations directly and communicate this information to
          the motor controls. This system enabled us to minimize vibration without needing to make the arm more rigid.
        </p>
        <p class="_mt20">Initially, though, there were no gyroscopic sensors small enough to fit the robotic arms.
          Accordingly, we developed a tiny gyroscopic sensor using our original quartz crystal technology. Mounting the
          gyroscopic sensor onto the robotic arm proved challenging due to the sensor's attributes. However, we overcame
          this challenge and produced a gyroscopic sensor compatible with the robots.</p>

        <figure class="_center _mt30">
          <img src="/en/technology/interview/img/img_kawai_002.jpg" width="720" height="480" alt="Hiroki Kawai">
        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Kawai</span>Many high-precision tasks, such as inserting tiny parts
          into slender gaps, were once performed manually, using human senses. The market was crying out for a way to
          automate these processes. We saw force sensors as a solution to this need.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Force sensors were already available on the market at the time. However, they were not rigid
          enough. When you exerted force upon the sensor, it would contort and deviate from the target position. They
          also had poor resolution, making precise locomotion impossible. Fragility was another issue. Sensors need to
          be shock-resistant because they move with the robot. In the end, we decided that if the market lacked any
          force sensors with the required rigidity, resolution, and shock-resistance, we would develop one ourselves.
          The result was the Epson force sensor.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Our force sensors use quartz crystals to combine rigidity with sensitivity. By embodying these
          paradoxical aspects, the sensors have enabled the automation of delicate and precise assembly processes that
          manufacturers once thought impossible to automate and for which they had relied on human senses. Examples
          include plugging in flexible flat cables (FFC) and inserting capacitors.</p>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>In what areas are robotics applied today? What are the future applications?</h3>
        </div>

        <figure class="_center">
          <img src="/en/technology/interview/img/img_motoyoshi_004.jpg" width="720" height="480" alt="Hiroki Kawai">
        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Motoyoshi</span>The most common applications today are in electronics
          assembly and transportation. Beside these, Epson's SCARA robots feature prominently in other areas requiring
          precision, such as the manufacture of precision instruments and medical instruments. We have built a strong
          market share in these fields. The market has grown rapidly at a global level. Many companies around the world
          are suffering from labor shortages and turning to labor-saving solutions. This socioeconomic trend suggests
          that robotics is no longer the preserve of large manufacturers-they will increasingly feature among small- and
          medium-sized enterprises too.</p>

        <figure class="_center _mt30">
          <img src="/en/technology/interview/img/img_kawai_003.jpg" width="720" height="480" alt="sensor">
        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Kawai</span>For companies that are struggling amid a labor shortage,
          robots are a boon. You can program robots to perform sophisticated processes repeatedly and consistently. You
          could then get a second or third robot to perform the same process alongside the first robot, thereby doubling
          or trebling the speed.<br>Another advantage is that a robot's sensor can provide you quantitative feedback of
          its sensory input. The robot logs the sensor data for production or distribution processes, so if something
          goes wrong, you can back-trace and identify when, where, and how the error occurred. Robotics also has
          applicability outside automation: Robots could quantify the artisanal techniques of master craftspeople,
          helping apprentices to inherit their craft.</p>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>As the market grows, what requirements will robots need to fulfill?</h3>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Motoyoshi</span>If the robotics market does indeed grow, robots will
          soon become accessible not only to skilled robot operators but also to the layperson. Take, for example, a
          robot's speed setting. In the past, it would take a skilled robot operator to set the speed at just the right
          level for ensuring both optimal performance and minimal vibrations. Nowadays, the robot can set its speed
          automatically, meaning that operators have a much easier task. Robots will need to be even more user-friendly
          so that they are accessible to all. To that end, we are exploring the potential of AI solutions based on our
          sensor and other original technology.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Additionally, robots will need to work in confined spaces. This requirement will become
          increasingly crucial as demand for small-lot production rises and more small and medium enterprises adopt
          robotic automation. To develop flexible robots that can fit into any space, we must go even further in the
          areas where Epson has always excelled: compactness, lightness, slimness, and energy efficiency.</p>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Motoyoshi</span>Our robots have minimal vibration, require little
          human input, and are easy to install. As well as solving the problem of labor shortages, they can help ensure
          that specialized techniques are transmitted to future generations. To meet the needs of the market, we will
          continue upgrading our robotics technology. Specifically, we will leverage our force sensors, gyroscopic
          sensors, and other technology assets to enhance the performance of robots on the factory floor, focusing as
          always on speed, precision, and quality.</p>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Kawai</span>Alongside Epson's commitment to efficient, compact and
          precision technologies, our various businesses have amassed a smorgasbord of technologies and devices,
          including image processing technology and sensing technology. If we combine these assets with the expertise we
          have gained in automating production, then we can create peerless, inimitable robots that are fast, precise,
          compact, lightweight, slim, energy-efficient, and user-friendly. These robots will enable automation in the
          delicate and precise manufacturing processes once written off as impossible to automate. We will continue
          refining our technologies to enhance the value of the automation and manpower-saving solutions they support.
          In this way, we will continue contributing to the development of a range of industries.</p>
