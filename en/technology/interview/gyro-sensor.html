            <p>Epson is one of the world's biggest developers and manufacturers of crystal devices. We produce a variety
              of devices, such as timing devices used in clocks, communication equipment, computers, and smartphones.
              Other examples are gyro sensors that are used in vehicles and cameras to detect angular velocity, and
              inertial measurement units, to which the gyro sensor technology is applied. As these examples illustrate,
              crystal devices feature in products that we use in our daily lives.</p>
            <p>We interviewed Norifumi Shimizu, who is responsible for the gyro sensors for vehicles (auto gyro
              sensors), including those that keep the car under control and those that control car safety features. We
              asked Shimizu about what makes the auto gyro sensors so special, what their future outlook is, and about
              his experience in developing the devices.</p>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Shimizu</span>Gyro sensors are devices that sense angular velocity
          which is the speed at which the angular position of an object changes. They have many applications. Large gyro
          sensors are used in rockets, aircraft, satellites, and ships. Smaller ones serve in smartphones, game
          controllers, and digital cameras.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">The gyro sensors I work on are for car safety features, including anti-skid braking systems and
          side-impact air bags. We get repeat orders for our gyro sensors because they demonstrate exceptional stability
          in all driving conditions.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">For gyro sensors, stable operation is paramount, and this is especially true in vehicular
          applications. Auto gyro sensors are only worth having if they perform just as stably in adverse driving
          conditions as they do in favorable ones. Otherwise, the results really could be fatal. Suppose, for example,
          that you are driving along a rough road. Unless the sensor performs stably in these conditions, the jolts
          might cause the airbags to activate or cause the car to go out of control. We wanted to ensure that this would
          never happen with our gyro sensor. Using Epson's proprietary hammerhead-type crystal sensing element, we
          created a gyro sensor that performs stably even when subjected to vibrations. The gyro sensor uses quartz
          crystal. Because this material is stable under a range of temperatures, the gyro sensor can perform stably in
          both hot and cold driving conditions.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">By providing gyro sensors that are resilient to environmental changes, we make driving safer
          and ultimately more comfortable.</p>

          <h2>From consumer markets to the auto market</h2>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>What was the inspiration behind the auto gyro sensors?</h3>
        </div>

        <figure class="_mt20 _center">

        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Shimizu</span>We have come very far in developing consumer
          applications for Epson's crystal devices. Starting from wristwatches, we later expanded to mobile phones and
          computers. The same goes for gyro sensors. We initially focused on camera-shake correction devices and game
          controllers and then expanded to car GPS navigation systems. Inbuilt car features was next on our list of
          target markets.</p>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>What challenges did you face in developing the product?</h3>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Shimizu</span>Our lack of experience in car safety proved a hurdle at
          first. We had a decent track record in the GPS navigation systems market, having carved out a large share
          there. However, we had no experience in measuring the angular movement of cars, a task that required the gyro
          sensor to perform even more reliably. Consequently, our own evaluation environment was inadequate, and we
          struggled to get the business up and running.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">We faced another challenge too. If we wanted the customer to use our gyro sensor for measuring
          the angular movement of cars, we would need to demonstrate that the sensor can withstand all kinds of driving
          conditions. We started by identifying the kinds of environmental stress the sensor is vulnerable to, the
          extent to which it can withstand these stresses, where breakage starts to occur, and what happens when it does
          occur. Next, we consolidated all this information and made improvements where necessary. Finally, we briefed
          our customers thoroughly to win their trust. The customers were convinced and decided to go with our product.
          To achieve the high standards that the customers expect, we have developed an in-house quality control system
          that spans departments including design, engineering, manufacturing, quality management, and sales. This
          system has become a most valuable asset for Epson.</p>

          <h3>What is the future outlook for gyro sensors?</h3>
        </div>

        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20"><span class="_bold _mr20">Shimizu</span>Epson's gyro sensors are exceptionally accurate and
          stable, but we are still looking to improve.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">The automotive sector is full of exciting possibilities. Automated driving and advanced
          drive-assistance systems (ADAS) are progressing, and these technologies are increasingly being installed in
          vehicles. Human-driven vehicles will soon be a thing of the past. Our business strategy has focused on the
          automotive sector, but only in terms of car safety features, such as side-impact airbags and anti-skid braking
          systems. For our next step, we will target advanced vehicle control. We have developed high-accuracy gyro
          sensors for consumer markets. If we extend this technology to applications related to automated driving and
          ADAS, we could produce sensors that detect subtle vehicular movements that conventional sensors would miss. In
          this way, we will enable stable vehicle control and thus contribute to safer and more comfortable driving.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">There is another market we want to target in the future. Specifically, our sensors have
          potential to form part of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) for monitoring the state of large structures or
          machinery. Such an IMU could, for example, monitor the angular velocity of a structure and issue an alert when
          it detects an abnormality. It could also estimate the deterioration of machinery. Until now, the user has
          performed these tasks, but in the future we can envision device makers taking on these tasks.</p>

          in the same development department as the team that leverages the potential of these crystals to develop ICs.
          This arrangement ensures close collaboration in the development of crystal devices. This in turn allows Epson
          to deliver efficient, compact and precision crystal devices to customers, and to do so in a timely
          fashion-which is one of Epson's great strengths. Another strength lies in Epson's in-house production system,
          which integrates all processes, including the process of producing synthetic crystals used in the devices.</p>
