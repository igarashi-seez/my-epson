          Not only is it convenient when in use, but when not in use, its square form and accent color add color to your

        <p class="_mt20">The EF-100 can be installed facing any direction, so you can easily stand it up to project onto
          the ceiling in addition to the wall.
          By projecting onto the ceiling, you can enjoy your favorite movie or TV drama while relaxing in your bed.</p>

              <h3>Designer's Message</h3>
            </div>
            <p class="_mt20">We put particular emphasis on the finish, in order to create something like an interior
              accessory.<br>
              The leather texture on the surface is designed to reduce the plastic feel and make it comfortable to the
              touch for carrying.<br>
              We also paid attention to the color of the metallic coating and the material of the fabric in the speaker
              section to match the trends in interior accessories.</p>
            <p class="_mt20">In addition, with this model, we wanted the user to feel excited from when the product
              arrives until they use it, so we designed everything involved in the product, including the colorful box
              that lets you imagine how you'll use the product, to the simple user's manual and the simple remote
              control which uses less buttons than the normal model.</p>

          <h3>Designer Struggles</h3>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">Since this is a genre that I have never worked in before, it was difficult to find the best
          design for it.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">We created more exterior prototypes of the design than for normal models, and listened to the
          opinions of people from various countries and regions to decide on a design.<br>
          As its specifications allow for projection onto the ceiling as well, we ultimately arrived at the current
          design, which looks natural when stood up straight.</p>
