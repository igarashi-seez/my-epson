          <h2>The Ultimate Cube</h2>
        </div>

        <p>The TM-m30 is a smartphone-operated printer that issues receipts. Assuming that the product would be used in
          small-scale stores and stylish customer service counters, our design work began by considering the feelings
          and behavior of the people serving the customers. The first requirement is a compact size. Not only the actual
          size, but the presence itself should also be modest.<br>
          That's what led us to the ultimate simple form, a cube. The cube, with the same size on each side, is the
          ultimate shape for representing a compact size, as it instinctively reminds the viewer that there is no
          clumping or waste of contents.</p>

            <p class="_mt20">The environment where receipt printers are placed and the circumstances where they are used
              vary from store to store. Orientation, height, on the counter, in the counter, cable routing - there are
              countless arrangements.
            </p>
            <p class="_mt20">We removed directionality due to the shape as much as possible and gave each surface an
              identical presence for a cube shape that naturally fits any location.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="_mt20">Even with a simple cube shape, if the operation is complicated, the product will be
              difficult to use. Therefore, we condensed the open/close switch, receipt outlet, and indicators into a
              single edge, placing the point of operation on the user's line of sight. When this single edge is facing
              the user, it is easier to perform a sequence of actions like checking the printer status by the
              indicators, taking away the printed receipt, and operating the lever to change the paper roll. We improved
              operability while increasing installation flexibility and space efficiency.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="_mt20">In a store, the worker and the customer face one another. This means that the back of the
              printer will face the customer, so we also took the design of the back surface into consideration.</p>
            <p class="_mt20">The customer display designed with this printer, which shows the amount of money and other
              information, is also consistent in design, so it naturally fits on top of the printer facing the customer.
            </p>
            <p class="_mt20">Depending on the installation environment, even if back surface is placed up against a
              wall, the power supply and other cables are designed so that they can be taken out from the left and right
              corners, allowing the unit to be installed perfectly against the wall without any gaps.</p>
