        <p>The MOVERIO BT-300 is a pair of smart glasses. Put them on just like normal glasses and you'll see a large
          screen appear before your eyes.<br>
          This product does not only project video, but also links that to the built-in gyro-sensor and acceleration
          sensor to let the user experience the video, creating a new video experience that is truly a feeling of the
          future. Designers and engineers have put various creative solutions into these smart glasses in order to make
          experiencing this future easier and more accessible.</p>

              <h3>Achieving supreme lightness</h3>
            </div>
            <p class="_mt20">One of the barriers preventing the use of head-mounted displays is weight. To remove this
              barrier, engineers are constantly pursuing compact optical engines and lens designs.
            </p>
            <p class="_mt20">The same is true for designers in their pursuit of lightweight products. The BT-300 has a
              silhouette that is stripped of all unnecessary parts. In addition, the thin frame is seamlessly connected
              to support the optical lens, expressing the lightness of the design.</p>
            <p class="_mt20">The engineers and designers worked together to pursue a higher level of lightness,
              achieving a weight comparable to that of sunglasses and a beauty to match.</p>

            <p class="_mt20">The temples and nose pads, which affect the fit, and the clings that hold the nose pads in
              place are made with eyewear technology and know-how. The temples are made of resin material used for
              sunglasses to enable them to flexibly follow any head shape for support. The clings use a titanium
              material similar to ordinary eyeglasses, thus allowing for fine adjustments to suit the shape of each
              person's nose.</p>
            <p class="_mt20">By applying optimal materials and techniques, we are now able to provide optimal comfort

            <p class="_mt20">At first glance, the controller has a simple silhouette, but as you can see when you zoom
              in, it has a detailed surface treatment. The trackpad area has a wave-like texture, the Android keys have
              small protrusions, and the area around the arrow keys is concave. These are designed to ensure that the
              user can accurately operate the controller using only the bare minimum of their sense of touch in their
              fingertips, while focusing all of their visual sense on the displayed content.</p>

            <p class="_mt20">Smart glasses that realize AR are products that have the potential to greatly improve the
              quality of people's lives.</p>
            <p class="_mt20">However, the early products were packed with many devices and were not user-friendly.
            </p>
            <p class="_mt20">For the BT-300, engineers and designers worked together for further improvements to create
              a design that is lighter and more comfortable to use, making smart glasses that are more accessible to
              many people.</p>
