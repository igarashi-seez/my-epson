        <p>The EP-50V is a high-resolution printer supporting the A3 extended size. With a wide range of color
          reproduction through its new 6-color ink, it can meet a variety of needs from posters and advertisements to
          hobby photography.<br>
          A3 high-resolution printers are used not only by photo enthusiasts, but also by SOHOs, restaurants, and the
          like to print posters that take advantage of their high resolution. However, since SOHOs and store backyards
          are very limited in space, printers need to be compact not only during installation but also during use.<br>
          Therefore, we pursued operability that can be used even in a tight space, along with the expectation of high
          resolution printing and reliability as a work tool.</p>

            <p class="_mt20">In order to express high quality printing while maintaining simplicity, the front is
              slightly tilted and the top edge is sharply angled to achieve a tight appearance. We paid special
              attention to details such as the weighty, large, round form, the control panel, and the thickness of the
              paper support that supports the paper during feeding, and by doing so, created a sturdy and reliable
              product that can withstand daily operation.</p>

              top surface features an embossed dotted matte that makes scratches and dust less noticeable. It provides a
              temporary place to store a camera or printed materials so you can effectively use the limited space around
