        </div>

        <p>The EW-M670FT and EW-M571T are A4 inkjet multifunction printers with high-capacity EcoTanks.<br>
          In order to meet the needs of customers who want to print a lot at a low cost, we have adopted a high-capacity
          EcoTank system, where the user fills the ink directly into the tank of the product itself. In order to
          eliminate the worries of spillage and hassles during ink filling, we have pursued operability that "is easy,
          provides peace of mind, and helps prevent spills." It also expresses the performance of the EcoTank while
          maintaining its harmony with the atmosphere. We have achieved both beauty and functionality.<br>
          We uncovered the latent needs of our customers and thoroughly eliminated their concerns to create a printer
          with a completely new form.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="_mt20">We aimed to make it as easy as a shape-matching puzzle that young children play with. We
              changed the shape of the bottle tip for each color to prevent mistakes when pouring in ink. Also, as
              inserting the bottle automatically starts the filling process, and the process automatically stops when
              the tank is full, there is no need to worry about the ink overflowing. Furthermore, the valve structure at
              the bottle tip prevents ink from spilling even when the bottle is upside down.</p>
            <p class="_mt20">It thoroughly eliminates the worries you feel when using it, and provides you with the
              peace of mind of an unprecedented, comfortable operating experience.</p>

            <p class="_mt20">The tank that protrudes from the unit front expresses the performance of the large-capacity
              EcoTank while harmonizing with the main unit. By using a simple round shape and a weighty appearance, we
              have achieved both the durability to withstand long-term use and harmony with the atmosphere.</p>

            <p class="_mt20">By placing the tank on the front of the main unit, we not only made it easier to fill the
              ink and see the remaining ink level, we also achieved a compact size almost the same as the ink cartridge
              model. The flat top surface was surface-treated to make scratches and dust less noticeable, and it
              provides a temporary place to store documents or printed materials so you can effectively use the limited
              space around your desk.</p>
