            converting not only intellectual property rights into value, but also by converting intellectual property in
            the broader sense, including things such as brands and data, into value.</dd>

        <p class="_mt20">To achieve this mission, we in Seiko Epson's Intellectual Property Division are emphasizing
          proactive intellectual property (IP) activities. <br>
          So, rather than reactively using our intellectual property rights to block third parties from exercising
          rights, we proactively position ourselves to respond to potential future intellectual property issues by
          obtaining and actively using intellectual property rights in anticipation of future business.

            </p>
            <p class="_mt20">
              (1) Envision the future landscape from data analyzed using an IP landscape, which associates various
              information with intellectual property information, and proactively make proposals related to the creation
              of innovations.<br>
              (2) Provide strong contract support for collaboration with third parties to facilitate co-creation
              activities with startups, companies in other industries, and universities.<br>
              (3) Contribute to an increase in brand value by protecting technologies, designs, and names that are tied
              to brand identity through a mix of intellectual properties (patent rights, design rights, trademark
              rights, and copyrights).
