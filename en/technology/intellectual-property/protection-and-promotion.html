      <h3>Epson's Policy Against Counterfeit Products</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="_mt20">Epson is actively engaged in anti-counterfeiting measures aimed at ensuring that customers can use Epson products safely and securely. When counterfeit products are inferior products that do not have the quality that customers have come to expect from Epson products, there is a risk that customer safety may be compromised, which in turn could undermine the value of the Epson brand that customers have come to trust and have a serious impact on Epson's business activities.</p>
    <p class="_mt20">Based on our Management Philosophy that emphasizes a relationship of trust with our customers and society, Epson operates our business with the utmost respect for the rights of others in accordance with laws, regulations, and corporate ethics. At the same time, in order to ensure that Epson's legitimate rights are also respected, in addition to taking legal action against counterfeit products, Epson is taking strict legal action, in accordance with laws and regulations, against products that infringe on Epson's intellectual property rights.</p>

    <div class="heading03">
      <h3>What are Counterfeit Products of Epson products ?</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="_mt20">Counterfeit products of Epson products include ink cartridges, ink bottles, ink ribbons, and toner, which are consumables for printer products, as well as watches and replacement lamps for projectors.</p>
    <p class="_mt20">As shown in the case studies below, counterfeit products are goods made to appear genuine by imitating the brand name, product shape, and other product features. In many cases, they are indistinguishable from the genuine item at first glance, and customers may mistakenly purchase them for the real thing.</p>

    <p class="_mt20">In order to protect our valued customers from being harmed by counterfeit products, Epson is promoting the 4 NOs Activity, which consists of “NO manufacturing,” “NO importing/exporting,” “NO selling,” and “NO buying.”</p>
