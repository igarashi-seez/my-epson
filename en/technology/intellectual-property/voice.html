        <p class="_mt20">Epson's intellectual property activities ("IP activities") are being promoted by approximately
          200 members of the Intellectual Property Division, IP-related personnel from development and business
          divisions, and IP-related personnel from Epson Group affiliates in Japan and overseas.<br>
          Here, four members of the Intellectual Property Division share their experiences in Epson's IP activities.

        <h4 class="_mt80 fsL">Expanding experiences from patent application prosecution to IP landscape surveys</h4>
        <figure class="_center _mt20 _mb30">
          <img class="_pc-w20 float_r" src="/en/technology/intellectual-property/img/man_1.png" width="180" height="180"
            alt="man">
        </figure>
        <p class="_mt20">Since my major at university was in the field of science, I started my career in patent
          application prosecution in the field of printers. Subsequently, in order to accumulate experience in the
          upstream stages of product commercialization, I was assigned to the patent application prosecution work in the
          field of technology development. I became involved in the formulation and promotion of IP strategies in
          addition to application prosecution for various development themes (sensors, etc.) that were being launched at
          the time, and I also gained experience in contractual work in joint development with universities and external
          partners. And currently, I am engaged in daily operations with the goal of contributing to management and
          business strategies through the use of IP landscapes.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">In this manner, I think one of the major characteristics of the Intellectual Property Division
          is that we can experience a wide range of operations within a single department, including not only patent
          application prosecution but also IP strategy formulation and strategic proposals utilizing IP landscapes. I
          myself have been engaged in a wide range of work while experiencing a sense of growth. In my current duties, I
          am deeply involved with the business and development divisions from the upstream stage of business, such as
          the creation of new businesses and planning proposals, with the goal of promoting innovation and creating the
          future. I would like to grow with my team members so that we can create and nurture businesses together.</p>

        <h4 class="_mt80 fsL">Worldwide trademark management in collaboration with operations divisions and sales and
          marketing</h4>
        <figure class="_center _mt20 _mb30">
          <img class="_pc-w20 float_r" src="/en/technology/intellectual-property/img/woman_1.png" width="180"
            height="180" alt="woman">
        </figure>
        <p class="_mt20">At the time I joined the company, I was assigned to a department that had nothing to do with
          intellectual property, but since I wanted to acquire some expertise and work in some specialized field, I
          applied for a transfer to the Intellectual Property Division. I was transferred to the trademark management
          department, where my main duties were to obtain and manage rights to the Epson Group's trademarks. It was just
          at the time when the organization was strengthening its trademark operations, so I, as well as other people in
          the department, was often required to do things on my own and with uncertainties, and I learned my work
          through trial and error.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">For some time after my transfer, my duties focused on procedures for acquiring and maintaining
          rights, but eventually, I became responsible for handling trademark-related contracts and managing trademarks
          for domestic and overseas subsidiaries and also became involved in brand management and the acquisition and
          sale of businesses from a trademark management standpoint. I also promoted the development of an internal
          system for domain name management.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Subsequently, after a period of maternity and childcare leave, I became a manager in charge of
          the trademark rights department, where I am currently working.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">For manufacturers, intellectual property may have a strong image of patents, but patents are
          not the only important rights in the execution of business activities. It is also necessary to provide broad
          support to operation departments based on intellectual property rights, not merely to obtain rights, and the
          content of work and required abilities also vary. As such, although there are difficulties, it is a very
          rewarding place to work. Because the Intellectual Property Division offers a variety of opportunities to play
          an active role, I feel that this is a workplace where I can develop a diverse career, even if I take maternity
          or childcare leave, or even while raising children.</p>

        <h4 class="_mt80 fsL">Transition from patent application prosecution to liaison work using patent rights</h4>
        <figure class="_center _mt20 _mb30">
          <img class="_pc-w20 float_r" src="/en/technology/intellectual-property/img/man_2.png" width="180" height="180"
            alt="man">
        </figure>
        <p class="_mt20">When I joined the company, I was assigned to the Intellectual Property Division, where my
          duties included prosecuting patent applications for printer-related technologies and reviewing other
          companies' patents. Following this, I had the experience of being a trainee at a U.S. patent firm. Currently,
          I am engaged in rights utilization in Europe and China, in other words, liaison work. Working closely with
          local attorneys, I am promoting infringement verification, litigation procedures, negotiations with opponents,
          and so on. Through these activities, it is rewarding to contribute to the business by maintaining and
          improving the company's brand and technological superiority.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">At Epson, we are engaged in IP activities through a mix of patents, trademarks, design rights,
          etc., and we have a team of members who have diverse experiences in handling the many types of work that we
          do. As an organization, we have the groundwork for people from all backgrounds to play an active role, and I
          think it is a great environment for people who are interested in and willing to tackle a variety of things.
        </p>
        <p class="_mt20">As for myself, my knowledge and experience in liaison work are still limited and I have a lot
          to learn. I would like to learn many things and improve my ability to respond to situations in cooperation
          with IP members, operations division members, outside attorneys, and other members of the company. I would
          also like to be able to plan and promote IP activities that contribute to the business at a higher level.</p>

        <h4 class="_mt80 fsL">More strategic patent acquisition activities in collaboration with the invention
          department</h4>
        <figure class="_center _mt20 _mb30">
          <img class="_pc-w20 float_r" src="/en/technology/intellectual-property/img/woman_2.png" width="180"
            height="180" alt="woman">
        </figure>
        <p class="_mt20">From the time I joined the company, I have been mainly involved in patent application
          prosecution. After having worked in patent application prosecution for the development division, I am
          currently in charge of work for the software design department. When I was in charge of work for the
          development department, I felt it was rewarding to be able to apply for and obtain patents for technologies
          that had not yet been implemented by other companies. On the other hand, in the technical field that I am
          currently in charge of, there are many competitors, and I do my work while thinking about how to protect
          Epson's technology using patents as a fortress.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Having the opportunity to gain a variety of experiences in such different fields has been a
          valuable asset for me.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">One of the characteristics of Epson's IP activities is the high importance of IP activities in
          the business activities. For example, while it is necessary to file applications for technologies to be
          incorporated in products, it is also important from a strategic perspective to file applications with an eye
          to the future. Without the consensus from management of the operations division, it is difficult to obtain
          onsite cooperation for such activities. On this point, Epson emphasizes IP activities, and we are able to
          obtain information from the invention division based on the consensus of the operations divisions. And it is
          very rewarding for me when I am able to convince inventors to engage in the activities that I am aiming for.
          In areas other than application prosecution, I have duties related to the utilization of our own patents and
          examination of other companies' patents. Such work often has to be done within a short deadline, but even with
          such restrictions, working as a team toward a goal and achieving results is rewarding.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">In this way, I feel the attraction of being in charge of intellectual property that belongs to
          a company is the ability to strategically plan and execute IP activities for the company's business.</p>
