        <p class="_mt20">To formulate and implement intellectual property strategies, Epson's Intellectual Property
          Division provides functional organizations for all types of intellectual property rights. In addition, each
          functional organization has Intellectual Property Staff (hereinafter, “IP staff”) for each technology and
          business development to formulate, implement, and promote intellectual property strategies in cooperation with
          the technology and business divisions.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">Original core technologies set Epson apart from the competition and create new value for
          customers. Epson protects these technologies by acquiring patent and design rights. Epson has won high praise
          and numerous awards since the 1970s at events such as the National Commendation for Invention, sponsored by
          the Japan Institute of Invention and Innovation. Representative awards from recent years are introduced here.

          Commendation for Invention</h4>
        <h5 class="fsL">“Invention of method to reduce printing unevenness during bidirectional printing with inkjet
          printer”</h5>

        <p class="_mt20">The invention relates to bidirectional printing by an inkjet printer in which a print head is
          reciprocally scanned over a paper surface to form dots. In the invention, dots formed during forward scanning
          and dots formed during reverse scanning are distributed to avoid poor uniformity in distribution. As a result
          of implementing this invention, it is possible to print with high speed and image quality because poor
          uniformity of dot distribution is suppressed even if there is misalignment in the reciprocal scanning. The
          invention enables inkjet printers of high speed and image quality for home, business, photography, and
          commercial and industrial use, and through print digitalization greatly contributes to reducing the burden on
          the environment, improving productivity, and cultivating a culture of photography, fashion, art, and more.

        <h5 class="fsL">“Invention of high brightness, high image quality projector using monochromatic laser light
          source”</h5>

        <p class="_mt20"> The invention focused on the fact that a desired color light can be generated by irradiating a
          phosphor material with laser light. A phosphor wheel is irradiated by monochromatic laser light, and red,
          green, and blue light are then produced from the resultant fluorescent light (yellow = red + green) and the
          monochromatic laser light (blue) and used as projection light. The laser light source is set to be digitally
          dimmed by pulse width modulation with high frequency to prevent image flickering. The invention has promoted
          the use of projectors that use a laser light source and greatly expanded the applications for projectors. In
          particular, use of projectors for signage and spatial design in various stores, facilities, and events has
          progressed. Also, the invention has contributed to opening up a new world of image expression called digital
          art, such as projection mapping and covering entire spaces with images.</p>

        <p class="_mt20">This “two-stage sieve” invention is one of the core technologies of the Dry Fiber Technology
          found in a dry process office papermaking system, which can make new paper from used paper on the spot. The
          invention is uses in the paper making system where a defibration machine breaks used paper down into its
          fiber, which is sorted with the fine-meshed first sieve and goes in turn to the second sieve. By this
          invention, paper manufacture can be realized by stacking the fibers that pass through the second sieve into
          uniform sheets.</p>
