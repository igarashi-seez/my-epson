          <h2>Epson's Acquisition and Utilization Strategies for Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">As a practice of proactive intellectual property activity, Epson is committed to building an
          intellectual property portfolio by acquiring various intellectual property rights (patents, design rights,
          trademarks, etc.) in an advanced, strategic, efficient, and effective manner.</p>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>Building an Intellectual Property Portfolio using an IP Mix</h3>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">Epson is developing an IP mix strategy to protect its proprietary core technologies and
          services through the acquisition of patents, design rights, and trademarks. Under the IP mix strategy, Epson
          is building a multifaceted intellectual property portfolio that includes patent rights for technologies
          related to brand identity, design rights for product designs, and trademark rights for names.</p>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>World-Class Portfolio of Patents</h3>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">The core of Epson's intellectual property acquisition activities is its patent application
          prosecution activities, in which Epson files for and obtains patents for inventions that are generated as a
          result of its technological development. Epson has built an industry-leading intellectual property portfolio
          and protects its proprietary core technologies by filing world-class patent applications, both in quality and
          quantity, in technology fields such as inkjet printers, projectors, robotics, and crystal devices.</p>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>Utilization Strategies for Intellectual Property Rights including “BP”</h3>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">Epson defines outstanding patents that elevate our competitive advantage and contribute to
          higher profit as Brilliant iP or Brilliant Patents (BP), and Epson is pursuing the acquisition of BP in a
          timely manner in response to the management and business environment.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">The ideal strategy for utilizing intellectual property portfolio including BP is depicted in a
          four-quadrant chart that shows how Epson implements its patents on one axis and how our competitors implement
          their patents on the other axis. The location of rights on the chart moves from the top-right quadrant to the
          quadrant on the top left, then the bottom left and, finally, the bottom right. Epson calls this a "C-Curve."
        </p>
        <p class="_mt20">Apart from this, Epson also utilizes its intellectual property portfolio for brand protection
          activities and brand promotion activities.</p>

                <p>Epson tries to ensure business flexibility by entering into cross-licensing agreements with
                  competitors who want to use our rights.</p>

                <p>Epson obtains a return on investment (revenue) by either selling or licensing to others rights that
                  have contributed to the growth of business through cross-licensing agreements.</p>

                <p>Maintaining rights is costly, so Epson actively abandons rights that are unlikely to be productive.
