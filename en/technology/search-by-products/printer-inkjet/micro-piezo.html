        <p class="_mt20">Epson's inkjet printing technology is used in home, office, and commercial and industrial
          printers. Since our printing systems form images by directly depositing microscopic droplets of ink on sheets
          of paper or other media, they generate virtually no waste ink, are far superior to analog and laser printing
          systems in terms of the environment and efficiency, and can theoretically print on almost any medium. Let's
          look at the Micro Piezo inkjet technology that powers every Epson inkjet printer.

            <p>There are two main ways of ejecting ink from a printer. The first is thermal technology, which uses a
              heater to heat the ink and form bubbles that cause the ink to be ejected. The other is piezo technology,
              which applies voltage to change the shape of piezoelectric elements, the mechanical motion of which ejects
              the ink. Micro Piezo printheads are extraordinarily durable because they are not subjected to heat-induced
              functional deterioration. They are compatible even with inks that would undergo changes of material
              properties if heated. Printers with piezo technology can use a wide variety of inks, including dye and
              pigment inks.</p>

        <p class="_mt20">Epson Micro Piezo printheads achieve superb placement accuracy with fast ejection of up to
          50,000 droplets per second by controlling the meniscus at the tip of each nozzle and by using variable size
          dot technology (VSDT). VSDT controls the volume of ejected ink droplets by precisely controlling the voltage
          wave form that drives the piezoelectric elements.</p>

              <h3>Meniscus control</h3>
            </div>
            <p>This technology harnesses the motion of precisely controlled piezoelectric elements to control the
              meniscus. By rapidly suppressing the residual vibration of the meniscus, it holds down the mist caused by
              residual vibration and ensures straight ejection of large and small ink droplets that are nearly perfect
              spheres and land with superb placement accuracy.</p>

              volume of the ink in ejected droplets. Ink droplets as small as 1.5 picoliters, or one one-trillionth of a
              liter, can be deposited in precisely the amounts and locations needed. Since each nozzle can selectively
              eject ink droplets in a range of sizes, users can enjoy fast output and beautiful image expression with
              virtually no graininess.</p>

        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20">Many issues had to be overcome to create Epson Micro Piezo printheads with all the advantages
          they offer. One challenge was coming up with an ink ejection mechanism using piezoelectric elements.
          Generally, piezoelectric elements with smaller surface area have less displacement than those with greater
          surface area, if they are of the same thickness. Therefore, increasing the level of resolution means less
          displacement of piezoelectric elements and less ink that can be ejected from the nozzle at one time.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Increasing piezoelectric element displacement is essential to selectively ejecting ink droplets
          of varying sizes.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">The thinner the piezoelectric elements, the greater their displacement under the same applied
          voltage. However, thinner piezoelectric elements are more fragile and thus hard to fabricate and handle. To
          solve the problem, Epson adopted a Multi-Layer Piezo, consisting of a stack of thin piezoelectric elements, as
          an actuator. We then developed a MACH (Multi-layer Actuator Head) printhead to eject ink through vertical
          vibration of the piezoelectric elements. This approach realized high density and responsiveness and
          dramatically advanced inkjet printing.</p>

            width="720" height="622" alt="MACH">
        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20">Several technologies were essential to achieving MACH technology. They included high-level
          fabrication and manufacturing of actuators, ultra-precise assembly to build the printheads, and advanced
          control to draw out the performance of the printheads. Bringing all these technologies together enabled
          Epson's MACH Micro Piezo printheads to deliver inkjet printing with high image quality, precision, and speed.
          MACH technology is not only at work in Epson printers today, but is employed by customers around the world,
          who are using it in a wide range of printing applications.</p>

        <p class="_mt20">Epson's Micro Piezo printheads continue to evolve today. PrecisionCore technology was created
          as an advancement on Micro Piezo inkjet technology to bring inkjet printing to a new level. PrecisionCore was
          created by merging a number of original Epson technologies, including dramatically advanced thin-film piezo
          (TFP) technology, high-precision MEMS fabrication processes that work in microscopic detail, ultra-precision
          assembly, and more, with the inkjet technology Epson has built up over many years.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">The PrecisionCore MicroTFP print chip, built with an eagerness for high precision and
          compactness, significantly enhances performance as the basic module of the printhead. With greater speed and
          image quality than ever before, the same print chip can be used flexibly to build a wide range of printheads
          for printing applications ranging from office to commercial and industrial.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">PrecisionCore technology expands the possibilities of inkjet printing from simple printing on
          paper to a wide range of fields, including even electronics and biotech applications. And through open
          innovation, we are working with partners that have all types of services and ideas to spur the creation of new
          markets.</p>
