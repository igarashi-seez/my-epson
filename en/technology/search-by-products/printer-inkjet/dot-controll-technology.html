          <h2>Dot Control Technology for Amazing Quality</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">All printers need to rapidly and consistently print high-quality images.
          However, consistently high speed and high image quality are not always possible due to factors that are beyond
          a printer's control, such as the type of paper. Dot control technology is what makes prints of amazing quality
          regardless of this.<br>
          Read on to learn more about the role of dot control and the technology behind it.</p>

        <div class="heading02">
          <h2>What is dot control technology?</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">Dot control technology is provided with Epson printers to achieve consistent, beautiful prints
          at high speed for a great printing experience. One of the important requirements for high-quality inkjet
          printing is accurate dot placement.<br>
          Epson's proprietary PrecisionCore technology helps achieve superb placement accuracy. However, when printing
          on a wide variety of different paper types, dot misalignment can occur if paper sags or slips during
          transport, making accurate dot placement impossible.<br>
          Dot control technology reduces image quality deterioration and enables the fast and consistent production of
          high-quality prints even when such variables are present.</p>

        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20">Dot control technology consists of a pair of technologies, halftoning and MicroWeave, both of
          which control image quality roughness and banding.<br>
          Dot control technology converts the ink volume obtained in the color management flow process using Epson's
          Color Control Technology into a number of dots in halftoning processing. The print finally appears after
          MicroWeave processing.<br>

              <h3>Halftoning</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Epson's halftoning not only reproduces the smooth and natural colors and gradations of the data but also
              minimizes image deterioration even if the dots are misaligned during bi-directional head scanning.<br>
              In addition to the dispersibility of the dots deposited by a combination of forward and reverse scans,
              image deterioration due to dot misalignment is minimized by improving the dispersibility during both
              forward and reverse scanning.</p>

              <h3>MicroWeave</h3>
            </div>
            <p>MicroWeave is a technology that makes banding (belt-shaped streaks and uneven shading) less noticeable
              even if there is a gap between paths.<br>
              Printing speed is often sacrificed to make banding less noticeable, but Epson achieves both high speed and
              high image quality with MicroWeave, which determines in what pass and what nozzles to eject ink for the
              dot arrangement determined by half toning and by optimizing and maximizing the dispersion of misalignment.
