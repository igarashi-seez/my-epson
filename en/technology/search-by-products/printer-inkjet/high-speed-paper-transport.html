          <h2>High-Speed Paper Handling Technology</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">Business printers support users in busy workplaces such as offices and schools where the
          capability for high-speed printing is in particularly high demand. Improving paper handling speed and
          improvements in printhead technology are important factors in boosting printing speed up to 100 sheets per
          minute<sup>*1</sup>. The following introduces Epson's original high-speed paper handling technology.</p>

        <div class="heading02">
          <h2>Advanced handling technology</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">For printing to take place, paper must be fed quickly and reliably from the paper cassette to
          under the printhead that ejects the ink. Paper is fed one sheet at a time between rollers and other components
          from the paper cassette up to the printhead. Precision control is required so that single thin sheets of paper
          are drawn into and discharged from minute gaps in the various mechanisms and fed without jamming.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">In the limited space inside the casing of a business printer, the paper path and mechanisms are
          complex. This means that advanced, high-speed paper handling technology and knowledge are required.</p>

        <div class="heading02">
          <h2>To achieve both faster and high quality printing</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">Warping of printed material that occurs as a result of the paper absorbing ink is an issue with
          high-speed inkjet printing. A variety of mechanisms and measures have been used to resolve this issue but
          roller feeding so far has had its limitations in high-speed printing of 100 sheets per minute.</p>

            <figcaption>Conventional feeding mechanism</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20">When paper is fed by conventional systems, roller slipping sometimes causes paper to bend. A
          particular issue is that paper attitude cannot be controlled when it is not held between rollers. In this kind
          of state, the paper, for example, bumps against the rollers, and sometimes flaps around under the printhead.
          This can also result in distorted printed images, ink staining caused by paper coming into contact with the
          printhead, and printhead malfunctions.<br>
          (The figures below show the various ways paper comes into contact with the printhead.)</p>

          <h2>Using electrostatic transport belts</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="photo-massege">
          <div class="text-wrap">
            <p>To prevent the paper from rising up or bending, Epson has adopted high-speed paper handling technology
              that uses an electrostatic transport belt, which transports paper by the attraction of static electricity.
              By this mechanism, the belt is made to travel directly underneath the printhead and paper is carried on
              the belt. Also located in this configuration is a mechanism for charging and discharging static
              electricity from the belt.</p>
          </div>
          <figure class="image bdG _bgcolor-white _pt20 _pb20">
            <img src="/en/technology/search-by-products/printer-inkjet/img/fig_high_speed_paper_transport_3.jpg" width="570" height="440" alt="">
            <figcaption class="_center fsS">Electrostatic transport belt</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <div class="photo-massege">
          <div class="text-wrap">
            <p>The electrostatic transport belt is charged so that paper can be held in contact against the belt to
              prevent paper from flapping around even under the printhead. To ensure attraction capable of standing up
              to high-speed feeding, static electricity is discharged from the paper surface (printing surface) to
              increase attraction force.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="image bdG _bgcolor-white _pt20 _pb20">
            <img src="/en/technology/search-by-products/printer-inkjet/img/fig_high_speed_paper_transport_4.jpg" width="570" height="440" alt="static electricity is discharged from the paper surface">
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">Use of the electrostatic transport belt in this way eliminates paper rising up and bending
          during feeding and prevents contact between the paper and printhead. This reduces ink stains that occur as a
          result of ink adhering to the paper. Speed fluctuation during paper feeding is also reduced, improving
          printing quality. High-speed paper handling technology using the electrostatic transport belt helps achieve
          high-speed, high-quality printing.</p>
