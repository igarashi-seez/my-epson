          <h2>Meniscus Control Technology</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">Inkjet printers form images by ejecting minute droplets of ink onto media. The quality of
          prints is largely determined by the shape of the ink droplets and the accuracy with which they land. Epson's
          Micro Piezo printheads uses unique meniscus control technology to constantly eject up to 50,000 spherical ink
          droplets per second with high landing accuracy, and achieve images of amazing quality at high speed.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="grid8 _mb20">
            <p>Inkjet printers print by exercising tight control over the ejection of minute droplets of ink, each
              several picoliters (a picoliter is one trillionth of a liter) in volume, from an array of nozzles. If you
              were to magnify a printed image, you would see that the image is made up entirely of minute dots.</p>
            <p class="_mt20">The dots are so small that they cannot be seen with the naked eye, but if the dots are not
              round or if they do not land exactly in the target position, images will not be sharp and beautiful, small
              text and thin lines will look blurry and the overall color will not be as envisioned.</p>

          <h2>Vibrating ink surface</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">The nozzle holes formed in an inkjet printhead are very small, about 20 micrometers (a
          micrometer is one millionth of a meter). The holes are precision processed into nearly perfect circles, and
          the ink droplets ejected from the nozzles are spherical. However, since ink is a liquid, there is surface
          tension at the nozzle tips. If ink droplets are continuously ejected, the ink surface (meniscus) can be pulled
          by the ejected droplets, causing the meniscus to vibrate. This can result in misshapen ink droplets and
          landing errors. In addition, a mist made up of tiny ink droplets is created when the ink droplets break away
          from the ink surface. This mist can affect the next droplets ejected or land on the print media, making it
          impossible to obtain the desired image quality.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">These effects can be reduced by waiting for the meniscus to stabilize after ink is ejected, but
          this would slow the printing process. If the movements of the menisci at the tips of the nozzles are not
          controlled, high-speed, high-quality printing becomes difficult, if not impossible.</p>

        <div class="heading02">
          <h2>Ejecting ink with meniscus control</h2>
        </div>

        <figure class="_center _mt20 _mb30">
          <img class="_w75" src="/en/technology/search-by-products/printer-inkjet/img/fig_meniscus_001.png" width="1091"
            height="477" alt="Vibrating ink surface">
        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20">Epson solved this problem by using meniscus control with its Micro Piezo printheads. Meniscus
          control technology controls the movement of the menisci by precisely controlling the voltage (driving
          waveform) applied to the piezo elements. If the menisci are not controlled, they will continue to vibrate
          after ink droplets are ejected, and it will take time for them to stabilize. So, to rapidly suppress vibration
          and stabilize the menisci, a waveform that is the reverse of the driving waveform that was used to cause
          droplets to be ejected is immediately applied. The time required for the next ejection cycle is thus
          shortened, enabling up to 50,000 droplets to be ejected per second. Meniscus control also enables consistently
          round droplets of various sizes to be ejected as needed with excellent landing accuracy.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Meniscus control technology maximizes the performance of Micro Piezo printheads and enables
          high-speed, high-quality printing.</p>
