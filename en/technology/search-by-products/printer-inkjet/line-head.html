          <h2>PrecisionCore Lineheads</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">Epson's PrecisionCore printheads are core devices that were developed based on our Micro Piezo
          inkjet technology. Our PrecisionCore lineheads are an advanced type of printhead that reach printing speeds
          that far exceed those in conventional inkjet printing.
          Business inkjet printers equipped with PrecisionCore lineheads can deliver 100 sheets per minute<sup>*</sup>
          at a resolution of 600 dpi x 1200 dpi.1 They therefore meet the demand for high-speed, high-quality office,
          commercial and industrial printing.</p>

        <div class="heading02">
          <h2>Blazing speeds</h2>
        </div>

            alt="lineheads">
        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20">Most inkjet printers are serial printers in which the printhead is rapidly moved back and forth
          over a page as the page is incrementally inched forward. Linehead printers, on the other hand, use printheads
          that are the same width as the paper and remain stationary as the paper is fed forward, enabling lineheads to
          deliver higher print speeds.</p>

        <div class="heading02">
          <h2>Original lineheads</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">PrecisionCore lineheads are produced through a combination of innovative thin-film
          piezoelectric materials and precision MEMS fabrication technology. They are compact and have high resolution
          yet are extremely responsive, provide impressively accurate ink droplet control, and deliver amazing prints at
          blazing speeds.<br>
          Epson increased the number and density of nozzles per print chip to achieve a resolution of 600 dpi x 1200
          dpi. Thirty-six of these print chips are arranged diagonally on a head with a width of about 43 mm. The result
          is a compact linehead with about 33,500 effective nozzles.</p>

        <p class="_mt20">PrecisionCore lineheads deliver astonishing image quality in the office, and at higher print
          speeds than laser printers with dramatically lower power consumption. Furthermore, since our print chips are
          modular and can be flexibly configured to produce a variety of printheads, they are expanding into commercial
          and industrial applications, in systems used to print items such as posters and labels. PrecisionCore
          lineheads have the potential to greatly expand the applications for inkjet printing.</p>
