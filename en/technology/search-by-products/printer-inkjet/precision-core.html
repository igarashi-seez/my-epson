        <p class="_mt20">Digital printing with inkjets in recent years has focused attention on on-demand printing and a
          wide range of applications. Inkjets are increasingly serving in many types of industries and uses.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">To give one example, conventional analog printing, often in the form of offset printing,
          requires a printing plate to be made. That takes additional time and cost. With people's needs changing faster
          every year, there is a growing demand for small-lot, high-mix printing. Digital printing with inkjets is
          growing correspondingly since no printing plate is needed. The shift from analog to digital printing with
          inkjets is already underway in certain fields where the supply cycle is short and there is a great deal of
          variety: photos and proofs, signs and posters, textiles, and labels. With no need for printing plates, digital
          printing can fill on-demand orders and users do not need to worry about inventory. Every print job can be
          easily customized and quickly supplied.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Printing nowadays offers both high speed and quality, while inkjets supply excellent color
          reproduction, efficiency, a wide range of applications, and environmental advantages. The shift to inkjet
          printing is even happening in the office, where laser printers have long dominated, and also in commercial and
          industrial printers.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">PrecisionCore is leading-edge inkjet printing technology. It meets these needs for inkjet
          printing while breaking open new markets. In addition to serial head printing, PrecisionCore supports linehead
          printing, which allows all sorts of printhead configurations so users can respond flexibly to different
          applications. PrecisionCore also supports a wide variety of inks and media. The adaptability of the technology
          ensures fast printing with outstanding image quality for consumers, offices, and commercial and industrial
          printing.</p>

            <p class="_mt20">PrecisionCore was created by merging high-precision sub-micron MEMS fabrication processes,
              key component technology forming piezoelectric elements as thin as one micrometer (0.001 millimeters), and
              more with Epson's inkjet technology and experience accumulated over many years. The PrecisionCore MicroTFP
              print chip, the next-generation print chip that is the basic module of the printhead, delivers
              blistering-fast inkjet printing with excellent image quality.</p>

          <h3>Thin-film piezoelectric (TFP) technology</h3>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">TFP technology makes it possible to form uniform, homogeneous piezoelectric element films just
          one micrometer thick on top of a silicon wafer. Epson's proprietary crystallization technology makes it
          possible to form high-quality ceramic crystals with stable orientation by sintering. TFP actuators made by
          this technology are thin with a homogeneous crystal structure, ensuring uniformly high displacement. The
          amount of displacement is about double that of conventional systems.</p>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>High-precision MEMS fabrication processes</h3>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) fabrication processes are one of the core technologies
          supporting PrecisionCore. MEMS fabrication technology integrates mechanical components and elements, sensors,
          actuators, electronic circuits, and more on a single silicon substrate, glass substrate, or organic material,
          all with sub-micron precision. Epson uses its MEMS fabrication processes with industry-leading precision to
          form the elaborate TFP actuators, ink channels, and nozzle plates that make up the PrecisionCore printheads.
        </p>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>Nozzle self-diagnosis system</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="photo-massege">
          <div class="text-wrap">
            <p class="_mt20">Two characteristics of piezoelectric elements are that they change shape in response to an
              applied voltage and that as they change shape, they produce a voltage. The nozzle self-diagnosis system
              uses these characteristics of piezoelectric elements as a sensor. It can determine whether the nozzle is
              ejecting normally and whether bubbles are forming that could prevent ejection. It looks for potential
              problems caused by rising ink viscosity. Detection time is measured in thousandths of a second, making
              self-diagnosis instantaneous.<br>
              Epson also tapped in-house robot technology that originated on our automatic watch assembly lines. Now
              developed into ultra-precise robotics technology, it is used on our PrecisionCore MicroTFP print chip
              automation line. These many Epson technologies working together give PrecisionCore both excellent quality
              control and stable productivity.</p>

          <h2>Fast, High Quality, Versatile Printing</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">PrecisionCore technology is changing inkjet printing fundamentally. PrecisionCore printheads
          offer more than double the resolution of earlier Epson piezo printheads. Fast printing with high image quality
          is possible because ink droplets are deposited in precisely the amounts and locations needed.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">PrecisionCore printheads fire up to 50,000 ink droplets per second from a single nozzle hole.
          In addition, by precisely controlling the voltage applied to the piezoelectric elements, the volume of ink
          ejected can be controlled. Technology that selectively ejects ink droplets of different sizes from a single
          nozzle realizes variegated printing with outstanding image quality. Curves come out smooth, small letters
          stand out in sharp relief, and even gradations and shape fills are rendered beautifully.
        </p>
        <p class="_mt20">In addition, the mechanism and ejection performance provided by the piezoelectric elements
          ensure that the PrecisionCore printheads are compatible with a wide variety of inks, including water-based
          ink, eco-solvent ink, UV-curable ink, and others.</p>

            height="751" alt="PrecisionCore Technology and the Future">
        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20">PrecisionCore technology is taking inkjet printing from the simple act of putting ink on paper
          to a whole new level beyond mere printing. With their large number of ink options, for example, PrecisionCore
          printheads can fashion circuit patterns with conductive ink or construct OLED panels or thin resists, so there
          is plenty of potential in the electronics field. In addition, Epson is partnering with outside parties that
          have new ideas and technologies, for such applications as biotech (bioprinting and drug discovery) and food
          products (decoration and flavoring). With such open innovation, the possibilities of PrecisionCore technology
          are unlimited.</p>
