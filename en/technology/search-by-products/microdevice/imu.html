          <h2>Epson Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) Contribute to Sustainability</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">Modern society faces the problem of global food scarcity due to explosive population growth.
          The United Nations has defined "Zero Hunger" as one of its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The theme of
          this goal is to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture.
          Epson's inertial measurement units (IMU) are helping to meet these challenges.</p>

            alt="help to address humanity's food problems">
        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20">Solving humanity's food problems requires: (1) reducing consumption and loss, and/or (2)
          increasing production efficiency. One of the ways to increase production efficiency is to efficiently produce
          large quantities of agricultural produce through large-scale agriculture. However, numerous challenges lie in
          wait for those who would implement large scale agriculture. These include increasing machinery size,
          increasing costs, machinery operator workload, and an aging agricultural labor force. One idea for addressing
          these challenges is the concept of precision agriculture. One of the approaches this encompasses is the
          roboticization of agricultural machinery. This entails automating and increasing the size of tractors and
          other agricultural machinery used on large-scale farms, then using autopilot technology to operate them day
          and night. This would improve productivity by making work more efficient and reducing labor requirements.
          Epson's IMU technology can contribute to this large-scale agriculture.</p>

          <p class="_right _w80 _mt20">Source: NovAtel, Inc</p>
        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20">Implementing autopilot technology that surpasses the piloting accuracy of human operators
          requires precise measurement of the machine's position, orientation and speed.<br>
          This necessitates GNSS/INS devices. A GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) is a satellite positioning
          system that uses global positioning satellites to calculate the current location anywhere on Earth. The most
          well-known example is the Global Positioning System (GPS). And an INS (Inertial Navigation System) is a device
          that can determine its own position and speed using only built-in sensors, without support from external
          signals.<br>
          Epson's high-precision IMUs are incorporated into both GNSS and INS devices, and are helping to improve the
          accuracy of autopilot technology on agricultural machinery.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Such improvements to the performance of agricultural machinery are important not only in
          industrialized countries, but in developing countries as well. And to spur adoption of this technology, it is
          desirable to reduce machinery costs. Epson's high-precision IMU provides new value in terms of both
          performance and cost. Moreover, this kind of IMU-enabled automation technology is needed in a wide variety of
          fields from ICT construction machinery, to autonomous vehicles, and industrial robots. IMU technology can be
          employed from an ecological standpoint to reduce resource use and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions through increased
          efficiency, and help to solve societal issues.</p>

          <h2>IMUs are indispensable</h2>
        </div>

            alt="measure the movement of objects">
        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20">Because they can accurately measure the movement of objects in three dimensions, IMUs are
          essential to modern society. They are utilized in many more applications than just the aforementioned
          automatic control and autonomous driving on tractors and other agricultural machinery used for precision
          agriculture. Examples include orientation measurement during autonomous driving, drone orientation control,
          camera and antenna vibration detection and control, and controlling the angle and attitude of blades and arms
          on construction and mining equipment. The high-precision detection of tiny changes in movement, which are too
          small for the human eye to detect, makes IMUs vital to high-precision data measurement and control of
          machinery.</p>

        <div class="heading02">
          <h2>Epson's high-performance IMU achieves miniaturization and low power consumption</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="photo-massege">
          <div class="text-wrap">
            <p class="_mt20">In this way, as demand has grown, IMUs developed for broad use in industry have gone on to
              be utilized in a variety of fields. In recent years, customers have sought IMUs with increased precision
              and stability, and ever greater miniaturization and low power consumption, that allow them to be easily
              incorporated into products.</p>

        </div>

        <figure class="_center _mt20 _mb30">

            alt="Allan-Variance model">
        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20">IMU technology uses a combination of 3-axis gyro sensors to sense changes in rotation and
          direction, and 3-axis accelerometers to sense changes in speed along their axis. This technology can detect
          the amount of inertial momentum to a high degree of precision. Epson's IMUs use high-performance quartz sensor
          elements created by applying our original MEMS (microelectro-mechanical system) processing technology to
          high-quality crystal material that features excellent stability, low power consumption and low noise
          characteristics. Employing a crystal method allows devices to exhibit the characteristics of low noise, high
          stability and low variability. And their linearity characteristics enable high-precision measurement of
          various kinds of movement over a wide range from slow to fast. This allows them to be used in a broad array of
          applications.</p>

        <figure class="_center _mt20 _mb30">
          <img src="/en/technology/search-by-products/microdevice/img/img_imu_5.jpg" width="672" height="191"
            alt="Gyro Bias Data">
        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20">Also, Epson has employed the SoC it developed specifically for industrial sensors based on the
          compact, low power consumption IC technology we have built up over many years. This has allowed us to created
          compact IMU products that greatly reduce peripheral equipment and power consumption, while maintaining high
          performance.<br>
          In addition to compactness, light weight, and low power consumption, they are equipped with correction
          functions to compensate for errors generated by things like vibration and temperature changes in actual usage
          environments. They accurately detect even minuscule declination and movement, and consistently output
          high-precision measurement data.</p>

        <p class="_mt60">In this way, Epson IMUs are contributing toward the realization of a sustainable society in a
          variety of ways. And we foresee their application in a growing and even more diverse array of fields in the
          future. We aim for our IMUs to help spark innovation in customer products, and believe they will become
          essential to both our customers and to society.</p>
