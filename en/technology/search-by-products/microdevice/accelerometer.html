            <p>The aging of infrastructure such as bridges and tunnels is a serious problem. And the need to improve
              safety continues to grow. Standardizing inspection quality and reducing management costs (labor costs and
              ease of installation) have become essential in ensuring the safety of infrastructure throughout the
              country. Epson is taking the approach of attempting to meet these needs through high-precision sensing

          <h2>Implementing predictive/preventive maintenance and disaster monitoring for infrastructure</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">The movements and changes in large-scale infrastructure such as bridges and tunnels are
          infinitesimal, and thus difficult to grasp quickly and accurately. Signs that indicate deterioration of
          infrastructure may lie hidden among these infinitesimal changes, and capable and accurate sensors are needed
          to accurately detect these. But the mechanical servo accelerometers commonly used can be large, heavy,
          expensive, and not easy to handle. On the other hand, inexpensive and easy-to-handle silicon MEMS technology
          accelerometers have too much sensor noise to measure infinitesimal changes, leading to user dissatisfaction.
        </p>

        <div class="heading02">
          <h2>Accelerometers that can detect movement and vibration</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">Accelerometers are sensors that detect acceleration. It is possible to calculate things such as
          the direction a body moves, the direction of gravity, inclination, vibrations, shocks, speed, and
          displacement. For consumer use, they are equipped on devices such as mobile phones and portable game consoles
          where they detect user movements or are utilized by the camera's display orientation adjustment function. In
          industrial applications, accelerometers serve a wide variety of purposes from measuring vibrations coming from
          earthquakes or the environment, to health monitoring of bridges and other structures.<br>
          Epson's sensing solution technology is based on high-performance quartz sensor elements to which the company's
          proprietary microfabrication technology is applied. Epson accelerometers equipped with these high-performance
          quartz sensor elements feature the outstanding characteristics of low noise, high resolution, wide dynamic
          range and high stability.<br>
          The basic principle of the sensor entails finding acceleration by affixing a weight to a component serving as
          a spring, and measuring the displacement of this spring due to the acceleration that results from movement in
          the axial direction. There are various ways of measuring this displacement: from utilizing a piezoelectric
          element to detect the changes in voltage due to the piezoelectric effect, to utilizing a crystal unit to
          detect the changes in frequency due to tension.<br>
          Epson's accelerometers employ a dual tuning fork type quartz sensor element made using our own high-quality
          synthetic crystal material manufactured in-house.</p>

        <div class="heading02">
          <h2>Uniting our in-house manufactured high-precision crystal chips with our semiconductor technology</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="photo-massege">
          <div class="text-wrap">
            <p>By miniaturizing the dual tuning fork type crystal oscillator chip, and applying photolithography
              processing used in our semiconductor microfabrication technology, we were able to increase the CI value (a
              yardstick for crystal vibration losses) and overcome the miniaturization limit beyond which it is
              difficult to obtain good vibration characteristics. Moreover, using SoC developed specifically for
              industrial sensors, we created a compact, high precision accelerometer that greatly reduced peripheral
              equipment and electricity consumption, while maintaining performance. Here too, we leveraged Epson
              semiconductor technology to achieve miniaturization and low power consumption.</p>

              height="430" alt="quartz sensor elements"></div>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">Because Epson accelerometers digitize the sensor quantities directly, no expensive analog
          conversion apparatus is required. High precision data can be processed with a computer as-is. In addition to
          providing resilience against external noise, high resolution, wide dynamic range, and high stability, we also
          offer items with a metal case to increase consistency through shielding, and items that feature waterproofing
          and dustproofing.</p>

        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20">These compact, high-precision devices are suitable for use in harsh outdoor environments, and
          are ideal for use when you need to obtain high-precision data over a long period of time. Such uses include
          analysis and diagnosis of deterioration and damage in large-scale structures as part of structural health
          monitoring, measuring vibrations from earthquakes or the environment, and bridge displacement monitoring.
          Epson's accelerometer technology helps solve problems concerning the difficulty of practical use in
          infrastructure, and contributes toward the realization of a convenient, safe, and secure society.</p>
