        <p class="_mt20 tIndent">The strength of Epson's MEMS fabrication technology is its excellent three-dimensional
          accuracy. MEMS are ordinarily fabricated using a semiconductor process for two-dimensional planar structures.
          However, Epson's silicon MEMS technology makes it possible to form complex 3D structures on silicon substrates
          to accurately produce things such as complex inkjet heads and tiny parts for wristwatches.</p>

          <h2>Principles and Features of Silicon MEMS Technology</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>Vertical fabrication technology</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="_mt20 tIndent">The silicon MEMS fabrication process can be used to completely penetrate a silicon
          substrate with a thickness of 100 microns or more, create complicated hollow structures, or freely create
          exquisitely accurate three-dimensional structures, depending on the functions required. Mechanical functions
          require production technology for controlling cross-sectional accuracy and designs engineered with precise
          stress calculations.</p>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>Thin-film control technology</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="_mt20 tIndent">Thin-film control technology is essential for fabricating MEMS. Not only is it used in
          the formation of electrical circuits and sensors directly on silicon, it is also used in etching control and
          silicon-to-silicon bonding. This technology takes advantage of optical interference principles to also produce
          decorative coatings. One of Epson's strengths is the ability to skillfully use a variety of thin films.</p>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>Assembly technology</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="_mt20 tIndent">For silicon MEMS parts to function, they must be carefully assembled with other parts
          or mounted in a circuit. As with semiconductor processes, this assembly requires extraordinary precision and
          accuracy. Epson utilizes know-how accumulated in its own watch assembly processes in technology used in the
          transport of thin, fragile silicon parts with a 3D structure.</p>

        <div class="heading02">
          <h2>How silicon MEMS technology will change the world</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20 tIndent">Silicon MEMS technology has many promising future applications. For example, if tiny
          MEMS devices with integrated actuators and sensors can be achieved, micromachines that work in the human body
          may become a reality.</p>
