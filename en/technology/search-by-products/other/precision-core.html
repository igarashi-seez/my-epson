          <h2>Original Technology Used to Manufacture PrecisionCore Printheads</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">PrecisionCore inkjet printheads are precision devices, and the complexity of their manufacture
          makes it extremely difficult for them to be reproduced. Epson is able to maximize printhead quality by
          combining inkjet technology that the company has fine-tuned over more than two decades with a
          microelectro-mechanical system (MEMS) microfabrication process that allows us to process parts on a submicron
          level. Moreover, Epson maximizes productivity with automated production lines outfitted with original robotics
          technology.</p>

        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20">PrecisionCore printheads can eject 50,000 ink droplets per second from individually controlled
          nozzles. The ink droplets are extremely small, weighing about 7 nanograms each. These crucial core devices
          largely determine the image quality and speed of an inkjet printer, and their production requires highly
          advanced technology. PrecisionCore printheads are manufactured at Epson's Suwa Minami Plant and Hirooka Office
          in Japan as well as at subsidiaries Tohoku Epson and Akita Epson, also in Japan. Production is accomplished by
          using the inkjet technology Epson has refined over more than two decades in combination with MEMS technology
          that enables these sites to fabricate components to 0.001 mm accuracy.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">PrecionCore printheads are fabricated using the same technology that is used to manufacture
          semiconductor integrated circuits.</p>

        <div class="heading02">
          <h2>Printheads that defy replication</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">The reason that PrecisionCore printheads are so difficult to manufacture is that the
          manufacture and assembly of MicroTFP print chips, the devices at the heart of these printheads, require three
          innovative technologies that only Epson possesses.</p>

        <ol class="list-square _mt30">
          <li>1. Thin-film piezo technology</li>
          <li>2. MEMS technology</li>
          <li>3. Ultra-precision assembly technology</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="_mt20">PrecisionCore printheads are made up of Micro TFP print chips. These chips are produced by
          bonding together three silicon chips-a TFP actuator, an ink channel, and a nozzle plate. Ink that enters the
          flow path in the ink channel is ejected from the nozzles by the pump-like action of the TFP actuator. Epson's
          innovative thin-film piezo technology is used to manufacture the TFP actuators, while its innovative MEMS
          technology is used to manufacture the chip components. Epson uses its ultra-precision assembly technology to
          assemble printheads from electronic components and components that form ink flow paths.</p>

        <p class="_mt20">Epson currently manufacturers MicroTFP print chips at its Suwa Minami Plant and Hirooka Office,
          using the same photolithographic process that is used to fabricate semiconductor integrated circuits of
          extremely fine geometries. TFP actuators are produced by uniformly fabricating extremely thin piezoelectric
          elements on silicon wafers. The piezoelectric elements are a mere 1 micrometer (1/1000 mm) thick. Even the
          slightest variation in thickness will result in uneven ink coverage.<br>
          In addition, the nozzle plates are processed using MEMS technology to create a precisely ordered array of
          nearly perfectly spherical nozzle holes a mere 20 microns in diameter.</p>

        <p class="_mt20">Completed MicroTFP print chips are transported to Tohoku Epson to be assembled in
          printheads.PrecisionCore printheads are assembled in four main processes that involve an ACT unit, holder
          unit, filter unit, and head unit. First, an ACT unit is assembled from print chips, a driver IC mounted on a
          film substrate (COF), and components that form an ink flow path structure. In the ACT unit assembly process,
          the parts are measured using image recognition so that they are aligned and automatically adjusted to an
          accuracy within ±0.001 mm. After assembly, the printheads are automatically inspected to ensure stable
          quality.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Six-axis robots and other Epson robotics and image recognition technologies are also used to
          maximize accuracy in all subsequent processes. By automating everything from workpiece transfers to
          inspections so that human intervention is not needed, we are also able to reduce the airborne particle count,
          which is important for maintaining printhead quality, as particles can cause clogging.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="photo-massege">
          <div class="text-wrap">
            <p class="_mt20">To ensure high quality and productivity, we not only automate the assembly and inspection
              processes, but we also manufacture 95% of the components that go into our printheads at injection molding
              and machine press workshops at Tohoku Epson. Moreover, the precision molds that are essential in the
              manufacture of PrecisionCore printheads are also manufactured on the Tohoku Epson premises. The number of
              manufacturers capable of making such molds is limited, so manufacturing them internally has helped
              guarantee excellent product quality.</p>

        <p class="_mt20">In 2019, Epson began producing PrecisionCore print chips at Building 9 at its Hirooka Office.
          Launching print chip production at Hirooka will triple Epson's print chip production capacity in the future
          and will enable Epson to meet the expanding demand for printheads-demand that is being driven by growth in the
          commercial and industrial printing markets. Increasing production capacity has also enabled Epson to sell
          printheads to other printer manufacturers around the globe.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">The Building 9 factory has a high production capacity yet mitigates environmental impacts in
          various ways. LED lights are used throughout the building and the latest LEDs are used for yellow lights in
          semiconductor fabrication equipment. The amount of construction materials was reduced and space efficiency was
          increased by using high-efficiency task and ambient air conditioning. Moreover, all the electricity needs of
          Building 9 can be met with renewable energy.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Epson is firmly committed to changing the world with inkjet and will provide PrecisionCore
          printheads that only Epson can produce.</p>
