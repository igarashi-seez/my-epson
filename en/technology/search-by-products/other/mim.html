          <h2>Epson Atmix's MIM Technology for Complex 3D Parts</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">Metal injection molding (MIM), which combines plastic injection molding and powder metallurgy
          techniques, is gaining popularity as a relatively new metal processing alternative to conventional sheet metal
          processing, milling, and casting. MIM can be used to make complex three-dimensional shapes, can be used with a
          wide range of materials, and is suited to volume production. It is thus used to manufacture parts for
          wearables, such as luxury watch casebacks, and complex external parts. It is also used to produce parts for
          products ranging from printers to medical equipment.<br>
          Read on to learn more about the MIM technology of Epson Atmix, which has world-class metal powder
          manufacturing and MIM processing technology.</p>

        <div class="heading02">
          <h2>MIM manufacturing process and features</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_center">The MIM manufacturing process consists of the steps below.</p>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>Mixing and granulation</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="photo-massege">
          <div class="text-wrap">
            <p class="_mt20">Metal powder and powdered binder are mixed under pressure and heat. The binder is composed
              of a binding material, plasticizer and lubricant, the latter two of which are wax components. Next, the
              mixture of metal powder and binder are extruded under pressure and cut, forming pellets like those of
              resin materials. High-quality metal powder developed and manufactured by Epson Atmix is used.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="image"><img src="/en/technology/search-by-products/other/img/fig_mim_1.jpg" width="570"
              height="440" alt="Mixing and granulation"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>Injection molding</h3>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">Parts are molded using an injection molder like that used for plastics. The molded workpieces
          are called green parts. Since the green parts contain a binder, they are made larger than the parts actually
          needed.</p>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>Degreasing</h3>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">Degreasing is a process for removing the wax components (plasticizer, lubricants, etc.) that
          are contained in the binder. There are three means of degreasing:</p>

        <ol>
          <li class="rounded _bold">(1) Solvent degreasing, in which a solvent is used to dissolve the wax</li>
          <li class="rounded _bold">(2) Heat degreasing, in which heat is used to vaporize the wax</li>
          <li class="rounded _bold">(3) Catalytic degreasing, in which catalytic gas and heat are used to achieve
            degreasing</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="_mt20">Workpieces that have been degreased are called brown parts. Care must be used in degreasing
          because the wax components escape from between the particles, which can lead to deformation and cracking. The
          degreasing process must be carefully controlled because if degreasing is not performed correctly, grease left
          behind will be present as carbon during sintering, affecting the composition of the metal after sintering.</p>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>Sintering</h3>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">The degreased brown parts are heated and sintered in a sintering furnace. The cubic volume of
          sintered parts will be reduced by an amount corresponding to the amount of binder lost. Sintered workpieces
          are called silver parts. Epson Atmix uses its own metal powder and MIM sintering technology to achieve a
          sintered density that was not possible with conventional MIM.</p>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>Sizing, machining (secondary processing), and surface finishing</h3>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">If high dimensional accuracy is required or if additional processing such as screw tapping is
          required, sizing (coining) or machining are performed. Like any molten metal material, MIM materials can be
          heat-treated, plated, painted, or given other surface finishes. Therefore, surface treatment is performed as
          needed.</p>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>Inspection</h3>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">In addition to the same dimensional inspections as those used with other processing methods,
          MIM parts are also analyzed for sintered density and chemicals. In chemical analyses, it is particularly
          important to monitor the carbon content. Some parts may also be X-rayed or subjected to other non-destructive
          tests to check for cracks or other internal damage.</p>

        <div class="heading02">
          <h2>MIM for complex 3D parts</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">Among the advantages of MIM are:</p>

        <ul class="list-square _mt20">
          <li class="_bold">high productivity;</li>
          <li class="_bold">a high degree of flexibility in terms of shape;</li>
          <li class="_bold">flexibility in materials used; and</li>
          <li class="_bold">excellent mechanical characteristics, including high density and high strength.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="_mt20">MIM allows you to create three-dimensional shapes that cannot be achieved by machining or sheet
          metal working. As long as the shape can be achieved by injection molding, there are not many limitations.
          Therefore, there are cases where multiple parts that were conventionally manufactured by milling or other
          machining operations can be metal injection molded as a single part to reduce costs.<br>
          3D printing is one method that can be used to create three-dimensional shapes using metal powder. However, MIM
          has an advantage over 3D printing in that it lends itself better to volume production, is more flexible in
          terms of the materials that can be used, and requires less post-processing.<br>
          MIM is a relatively new processing method that takes time to learn, but Epson Atmix has been engaged in the
          MIM business since the 1980s when the technology was introduced to Japan. We are able to manufacture
          high-quality MIM parts because we have expertise in the entire production process, from the manufacture of our
          own powders to the molding process. Epson Atmix is differentiated by its ability to sinter workpieces to a
          density of 99.5%, stably produce very small parts with complex shapes in high volumes, and process parts made
          from titanium and titanium alloys using MIM.</p>

        <div class="heading02">
          <h2>Metal powder manufacturing technology</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">Epson Atmix manufactures its own metal powders. There are physical, chemical, and electrical
          methods for producing the metal powders used in MIM, but we use water atomization, a process in which molten
          metal is reduced to fine particles by blasting it with water. The features of water atomization are as
          follows:</p>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>Ultra-high pressure water atomization process</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="photo-massege">
          <div class="text-wrap">
            <p class="_mt20">In this water atomization process, highly pressurized jets of water impinge on a stream of
              molten metal, causing it to atomize. Whereas conventional water atomization produces particles with an
              average diameter of 15 microns, Epson Atmix's process produces metal powder with an average particle size
              of 5 microns. MIM, which uses fine powder as a raw material, can obtain high mechanical strength even when
              sintered at relatively low temperatures such as 1,000â, so energy can be saved in the manufacturing
              process. In addition, material made from such fine powder flows easily and fills molds well and can be
              used for very small and complex shapes. It also has good surface roughness, eliminating the need for
              surface treatment after sintering.</p>

          <h2>MIM parts can be used for everything from wearable products to printers to medical equipment.</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_center">MIM parts manufactured by Epson Atmix are used in a variety of fields. Some of the most
          common are listed below.</p>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>Examples of uses in the Epson Group</h3>
        </div>

        <p class="_bold _mt30 _mb8">Wearable products</p>
        <p class="_mt10">MIM parts are used as Epson luxury watch casebacks, cases, and external parts with complex
          shapes.</p>
        <p class="_bold _mt30 _mb8">Printer parts</p>
        <p class="_mt10">MIM parts are used in Epson's impact dot matrix printers. These parts are made from a material
          called permendur, an iron-cobalt alloy that has a high saturation magnetic flux density, so it is an
          indispensable part for high-performance impact dot matrix printers.</p>
        <p class="_bold _mt30 _mb8">Digital textile printer parts</p>
        <p class="_mt10">MIM parts are found in the printheads used in Epson's digital textile printers.</p>
        <p class="_bold _mt30 _mb8">Parts used in force sensors for 6-axis robots</p>
        <p class="_mt10">The upper and lower blocks used in force sensors for Epson's 6-axis industrial robots are also
          manufactured using MIM parts.</p>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>Examples of uses by Epson customers</h3>
        </div>

        <p class="_bold _mt30 _mb8">Dental braces</p>
        <p class="_mt10">Small stainless-steel brackets with a complex shape that are used in braces to hold a wire are
          made using an MIM process.</p>
        <p class="_bold _mt30 _mb8">Dental handpieces and surgical instruments</p>
        <p class="_mt10">Dental handpieces and surgical instruments are made of pure titanium and titanium alloys that
          are hygienic and have a low risk of triggering allergies. MIM is also used to volume-produce parts from
          difficult-to-process materials, where the parts are a single piece for reasons of hygiene and have a
          three-dimensional shape that fits the user's hand.</p>
