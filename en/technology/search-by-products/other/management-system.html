          <h2>Centralized Administrative Management System that Ensures Production Efficiency</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">If a large number of items such as printers and robots are networked and centrally managed as
          production equipment, system managers can reduce their workload while also quickly providing support over a
          network. Epson used to develop management systems for each product. Later, we built a centralized
          administrative management system that enables system managers to centrally manage multiple machines In this
          way, Epson has become able to provide higher maintenance and management efficiency that satisfies the
          customers' requirements.</p>

        <div class="heading02">
          <h2>Corrective maintenance that puts a heavy burden on the production floor</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">When Epson printers and robots were introduced to a factory, the system manager first needed to
          configure the motion and other controls of an individual product. Then, after starting operation, the
          maintenance person needed to physically check the status and conditions of each product. If a product failure
          occurred on a management system that was not networked, Epson support engineers had to visit the actual site
          to check and understand the mode of failure. Since the engineers first figured out the failure on-site, they
          often needed to shuttle back and forth to finish repairs if they did not bring the necessary parts. Production
          lines were stopped during that time, causing a drop in production efficiency.<br>
          If Epson products were managed in a block using management software, the burden for corrective maintenance and
          inspections performed by the system managers would be significantly reduced. In addition, if Epson support
          engineers could remotely assess conditions, maintenance work efficiency would be increased, offering an
          advantage in terms of production efficiency.</p>

            alt="Epson Device Admin">
        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20">To solve these problems, machines need to be operated online and, therefore, we developed Epson
          Device Admin as a centralized management system. The system enables central management of large printers
          mainly used in factories by connecting them on an intranet. Epson Device Admin displays the status of
          printers, such as the remaining paper and ink volume, on the screen, and system managers no longer need to
          physically go around the printers to check them. Epson's support engineers can also understand the status of
          printers remotely, helping them perform maintenance work more quickly and efficiently.</p>

            alt="new machinery management platform">
        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20">The centralized administrative management system was also needed for robots used in factories.
          Epson therefore developed a new machinery management platform that is commonly used for various types of
          products based on the Epson Device Admin.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">The target products connected on a private network (intranet) are managed using model
          management software that is used for central management of corrective maintenance. Data collected from
          printers is managed on a server and linked with Epson's support engineers. To be versatile as machinery
          management software, the system was divided into three parts: a front-end part that users operate, a back-end
          part that collects data from products and externally shares data with Epson's support engineers, and an agent
          part that communicates with products and operations.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Each function is built as a module and the necessary service is provided in collaboration with
          software that is developed according to the user's requirements and environment. The server configuration can
          also be modified depending on the environment.<br>
          We have achieved a highly versatile system in order to flexibly respond to the diversification of production
          control systems brought about by changes such as distributed production and remote maintenance management.</p>

        <p class="_mt20">We developed the Epson Robot Management System based on the centralized management system
          platform.<br>
          Users can centrally manage multiple robots connected by intranet using a computer or smartphone. They can
          retrieve data from each robot, update firmware and operation programs, and perform other tasks from the
          system. Even in environments where different types of robots are used together (e.g. 6-axis robots and SCARA
          robots), up to 200 units can be centrally managed on the same network. In the future, the system will be
          compliant with OPC-UA, an industry standard protocol for IoT, and we will develop remote robot management and
          failure prediction systems to install in various products.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Establishing a platform for the centralized administrative management system broadens potential
          uses not only for printers and robots but also for other products. We will continue to contribute to the
          improvement of productivity by responding to the growing need for distributed printing and online management
          from both the hardware and software end.</p>
