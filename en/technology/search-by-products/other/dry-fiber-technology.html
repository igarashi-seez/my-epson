          <h2>Dry Fiber Technology: Creating Value from Waste</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">Dry Fiber Technology, a proprietary set of technologies developed by Epson, transforms fibrous
          materials into tangible value without using water.<sup>1</sup> It produces highly functional materials by
          defibrating, binding, and forming fibrous materials as needed depending on the application. Dry Fiber
          Technology allows you to handle and process materials in ways you couldn't before, which not only reduces
          wastes but also produces new material characteristics.<br>
          Dry Fiber Technology adds value to what was once treated as waste and reduces the impact on the environment.
          We have named this type of manufacturing SmartCycle.</p>

          <h2>The world's first dry-process office papermaking system</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">One of the products that uses Dry Fiber Technology is the PaperLab, the world's first office
          papermaking system<sup>2</sup>, a machine that produces new paper from used paper without using water for
          defibration.Offices often hire a recycling service provider to collect and recycle their used paper. At paper
          recycling plants, used paper is broken down and separated into fibers in a mixture of water and chemicals. The
          fibers are then usually bleached before again being processed into paper. Recycling paper waste to reduce
          environmental impacts is problematic because the process consumes tremendous water resources.If paper can be
          made without using water, the paper recycling cycle will change dramatically. Epson's Dry Fiber Technology has
          made this papermaking dream possible.</p>

        <p class="_mt20">We first sought to recycle paper that comes out of offices. Government offices and many
          businesses ordinarily use a paper recycling company to collect and recycle sensitive documents. However, for
          security reasons, they need to have an employee accompany the boxes of documents from pickup to pulping.
          Document disposal is burdensome as a result. Dry Fiber Technology development therefore began with a search
          for ways to completely dispose of used paper on-site, in the office.<br>
          Paper recycling plants use huge amounts of water to turn paper waste into pulp, but offices usually do not
          have the necessary plumbing facilities to supply and drain large amounts of water. Therefore, we needed to
          develop a way to recycle paper without using water. We tried thousands of different dry methods before coming
          up with a method of defibrate paper mechanically by subjecting it to impacts.<br>
          Next, we needed to find a way to remove the inked parts of printed paper without washing it. A member of the
          development team who used to work with laser printers used laser technology to sort colored fibers from
          non-colored fibers. A binding material called PaperPlus that Epson developed is added to the non-inked fibers.
          These fibers are then formed into sheets of new paper.<br>
          Since Dry Fiber Technology reduces paper to fibers, sensitive documents can be securely destroyed on site.</p>

              Association for Industry (JEMAI) in recognition of the paper recycling technology excellence and
              innovativeness of the PaperLab, as well as for its use in producing environmental education materials, its

        <p class="_mt20">Epson's Dry Fiber Technology enables a SmartCycle by creating value from things that were once
          disposed of as waste and reducing the impact of manufacturing operations.Recently, for example, Epson collects
          used paper internally and uses the fibers from it to produce absorbent ink pads for Epson printers. Epson has
          also used Dry Fiber Technology to form the filtration layer situated between a mask's inner and outer layers
          from functional fibers, thus enabling the company to rapidly launch mask production.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Dry Fiber Technology can, in principle, extract fibers not only from paper but also from
          anything made of fibers, such as lumber and bamboo. Rather than recycling waste to use again in its original
          form, Dry Fiber Technology takes waste and creates new materials. Epson will continue to research ways in
          which the fibers that are produced can be used as resources.</p>
