          <h3>How 3LCD projectors faithfully reproduce images</h3>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">There are two major types of projection systems: LCD (liquid crystal display) systems, such as
          those designed and built by Epson, and DLP systems. Epson's LCD projection systems separate the light from the
          light source into the three primary colors of light: red, green, and blue (RGB). Each of the beams of light
          passes through a different LCD, one for each of the primary colors. So, a red image is created on one LCD, a
          green image on another, and a blue image on the third. The three beams are recombined into a single beam with
          a special prism before they reach the projection lens, thus producing a faithful and vivid full-color image.
          The images look natural and do not suffer from an issue called color breakup or rainbow effect, which occurs
          when colors are presented sequentially.</p>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>Why the three primary colors of light are indispensable for color reproduction</h3>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">There are two sets of primary colors, one for light and one for pigments. Light is composed of
          three primary colors: red (R), green (G), and blue (B).</p>
        <p class="_mt20">PC monitors and other light-emitting devices reproduce all the colors we see with just these
          three colors. When there is no light, we see black. Light becomes brighter as colors are added. And when all
          three colors are equally combined, we see white light. Conversely, the three primary colors of pigments used
          in things such as magazines and paintings are perceived as colors according to how they absorb and reflect
          light. In the absence of pigment, objects appear transparent (white). Objects become darker as colors are
          added, and when all three colors are combined, we see black.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Since projectors reproduce colors by projecting light on a screen, it means that they render
          images using the three primary colors of light.</p>

          <h3>3LCD projector structure</h3>
        </div>

        <figure class="_center _mt20 _mb30">
          <img src="/en/technology/search-by-products/projector/img/img_3lcd_02_02.jpg" width="960" height="450" alt="">

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>Core devices and technologies for extraordinarily detailed images</h3>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">The white light emitted from the light source in a 3LCD projector passes through dichroic
          mirrors, which separate the light into its R, G, and B components. The dichroic mirrors are coated with a thin
          film that reflects light of a specific wavelength. These mirrors accurately separate the light into three
          beams, without loss.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Each beam of light is sent to its designated LCD, a high-temperature polysilicon TFT liquid
          crystal panel ("HTPS" panel) developed by Epson. These HTPS panels are a key determinant of projector
          performance. They are transmissive and use an active matrix addressing scheme. The advantages of this type of
          LCD are their small size, high pixel density, high contrast, and the capability to integrate driver circuitry.
        </p>
        <p class="_mt20">The amount of light transmitted by these high-performance HTPS panels can be precisely
          controlled, so beautiful, natural gradations can be rendered even in dark areas of images where that used to
          be difficult.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">A dichroic prism combines the red, green, and blue images generated by the three HTPS panels
          into a single image before projection. The dichroic prism is a rectangular parallelepiped made by bonding
          together four triangular prisms. If the triangular prisms do not fit perfectly together and there are minute
          gaps between the bonded surfaces, dark lines or double images will be visible in projected images. The
          processing and bonding of the triangular prisms thus demands extreme precision. Epson uses the optical
          processing technology it has developed over many years to manufacture high-quality dichroic prisms that enable
          our projectors to reproduce beautiful, vivid images.</p>

          <h3>Epson's 3LCD projectors</h3>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">Epson's 3LCD projectors not only deliver bright whites but also bright colors. The brightness
          of white light has so far been the standard for projector brightness, but Epson projectors achieve high
          numbers for color light output, i.e., color brightness. This indicates the projected images are bright and
          vivid, with faithfully reproduced colors and amazing clarity.</p>
