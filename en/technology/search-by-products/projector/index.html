        </div>
        <p class="_mt20">The opportunities to watch projected images and the time people spend viewing them has
          increased rapidly in recent years. Today, people in remote locations routinely use videoconferencing and video
          chat apps to communicate with one another. The importance of communication that makes more effective use of
          still images, video, and other visual information on a large screen is growing.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">As a leading projector company, Epson will introduce innovative products centered around high
          technology in various categories in order to meet the ever-expanding needs of visual communication.</p>

        <p class="_mt20">Laser projectors produce bright, vivid images, have a long-lasting light source, and can be
          installed at any angle. Epson will accelerate business growth in the high-lumen segment by evolving laser
          light source engine platforms to efficiently expand and upgrade the product lineup.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">To allow people to enjoy big-screen entertainment at home, we will expand and upgrade the
          lineup of compact models and ultra-short throw models, giving them attractive designs that blend into the home
          interior.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">We will also highlight the advantages of projectors to create demand for accent lighting
          projectors for use in stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues.</p>

        <p class="_mt20">Even students in the back of the classroom can clearly see the content. Classrooms are one
          place where we can demonstrate the value of large projected images. We are thus focusing our efforts on
          providing products and services for education. In 2006, we developed the world's first dust-proof projectors
          for use in dusty and sandy regions.<sup>1</sup> Epson seeks to use ICT to enhance learning and improve the
          quality of education, and in so doing has earned a strong reputation in the education field by providing
          affordable projectors and models equipped with electronic blackboard functions. Moving ahead, we will fulfill
          our social responsibility by continuing to apply Epson ICT technology in ways that enhance learning and by
          helping to improve the learning environment around the world.</p>
