              and adjusting the projectors for this requires specialized skills and knowledge, and takes time. With
              ordinary projectors, you need a separate external camera or instrument to help simplify the work. Epson
              projectors, however, use a special algorithm and built-in cameras to make image adjustment quick and easy.

          <h2>The advanced technology behind the large,<br>
            compelling images created with multiple projectors
          </h2>
        </div>

            alt="Images created using multiple projectors">
        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20">Multi-projection is used for a wide variety of applications and purposes, to bring a space
          alive by delivering large, compelling images at events, shopping complexes, and more. The use of multiple
          projectors gives you the freedom to create huge portrait or landscape images that cover entire walls in large
          venues, but the installation and adjustment work required to perfect such images usually requires advanced
          alignment skills.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Things such as color, brightness, and pixel position can differ from one projector to another
          for a variety of reasons, including slight errors in projected images due to differences in individual
          projector parts and changes in the products over time. So, when multiple projectors are used to form a single
          image, one must adjust the installation position of the projectors, match their color and brightness, make
          geometric corrections, and so forth. Many of these adjustments are done manually, and the knowledge and
          experience of the person making the adjustments greatly affects the outcome. Automating this adjustment work
          is the best way to reduce the difficulty involved, but achieving a level of accuracy equal to or better than
          that which can be achieved manually is no small feat.</p>

          <h2>Built-in cameras and image processing technology</h2>

        <p class="_mt20">Epson builds cameras and other devices into its projectors to enable auto-adjustment of color,
          brightness, and various other parameters. When setting up multiple projectors to project a single large,
          uniform image, the built-in cameras take measurements of the projected images. This data is used to
          automatically adjust the position, color, brightness, and other characteristics of the projected images.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">The built-in cameras make color calibration adjustments easy. They enable pixel color
          uniformity correction and color correction of the total projected image even without a colorimeter. The
          cameras themselves are optimized by individually adjusting them at the factory to match the output light. A
          camera and the human eye have different sensitivities to light wavelengths, so a color that looks the same to
          a camera might look different to the human eye. The amount of error is reduced by making corrections that
          bring the projected light measured by the camera closer to the sensitivity of the human eye.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">The position of the projection surface must be accurately measured with the cameras to
          automatically perform geometric correction when using multiple projectors. Epson has enabled the built-in
          cameras to accurately measure projection position by using a specially designed projection pattern for
          measurement purposes. The built-in cameras measure the entire projection surface and its surroundings. The
          measured data are integrated into one projector to cover the entire multi-projection screen.<br>
          The time and effort required to set up cameras to take measurements increases along with the number of
          projectors. With Epson projectors that have built-in cameras, all users have to do is set up the projectors.
          Furthermore, the cameras are compatible with various optional projection lenses, so there is excellent
          scalability.<br>
          Epson uses a unique algorithm to process the measurements. The measured data are used to facilitate the
          automatic creation of a single seamless image from tiled images by blending the edges without the need for
          special equipment. This not only makes it easier to set up a multi-projection system but also makes it easier
          to readjust the system after a certain period of use, improving convenience.</p>

        <p class="_mt20">Epson projectors with built-in cameras allow you to quickly and easily perform setup and
          adjustment tasks that previously required separate external devices such as cameras and advanced skills.<br>
          To further improve future projector usability, we will increase the accuracy of automatic adjustments and
          expand the range of applications, with support for three-dimensional and patterned surfaces and more.</p>
