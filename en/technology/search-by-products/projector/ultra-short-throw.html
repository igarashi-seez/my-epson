          <h2>Compact, Stylish Ultra-Short Throw Projectors Offer Installation Flexibility</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">Epson developed ultra-short throw projectors to alleviate issues with standard projectors,
          which cast the shadow of anyone standing in front of the projector on the screen, produce bothersome glare
          from the light source, and are often installed in front of viewers, where they can get in the way.</p>

        <div class="heading02">
          <h2>Ultra-short throw projector</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>Ultra-short throw projectors produce a large image from a short distance</h3>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">Unlike standard-throw projectors, ultra-short throw projectors can cast a large image even when
          installed a very short distance from a wall or screen. For example, an ultra-short throw model may be able to
          cast an 80-inch image on a screen from a distance of 50 cm.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Ultra-short throw projectors offer three main advantages.</p>

        <ul class="list-square _mt30">
          <li>They can be installed close to the projection surface.</li>
          <li>They typically do not cast large shadows.</li>
          <li>They don't get in the way.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="_mt20">When using a standard-throw projector, the presenter often stands in front of the projection
          surface. The problem with this is that the presenter may cast a shadow on the screen, making the content hard
          to see. Moreover, the presenter may be bothered by glare from the projector light source.<br>
          However, ultra-short throw projectors can be set up closer to the projection surface and forward of where a
          presenter would stand. Consequently, shadows and glare are less likely to be a problem.</p>

        <p class="_mt20">Interactive projectors, which capitalize on this feature of ultra-short-throw systems, have
          become popular in recent years. Users can annotate and interact with projected images using an interactive
          pen. They can even operate the PC from a projected image and share projected images with other projectors over
          a network. Features like these are fueling an expansion of demand in classrooms and business.</p>

        <p class="_mt20">The projection lens is critical for an ultra-short throw projector. Epson uses two types of
          ultra-short throw projection lenses in its projectors, ones with folded optics and ones with a concave mirror.
        </p>

        <div class="heading02">
          <h2>How an optional ultra-short throw lens<br>
            with folded optics enables a wide lens shift range</h2>

        <div class="photo-massege">
          <div class="text-wrap">
            <p class="_mt20">The ultra-short throw projection lenses used in high-lumen Epson projectors have folded
              optics. A projection lens with folded optics uses two flat mirrors to bend the projected light 180 degrees
              so that images are projected toward the rear of the projector. Therefore, when a projection lens with
              folded optics is mounted on a projector, the projector is installed backwards, for rear-projection
              applications.<br>
              A large-diameter aspherical lens is used on the exit side of the projection lens to minimize image
              distortion and aberration.</p>
          </div>
          <figure class="image _center">
            <img class="_w50" src="/en/technology/search-by-products/projector/img/img_elplx01.jpg" width="570"

          </figure>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">High-lumen models are equipped with lens shift functionality. Lens shift moves the projection
          lens horizontally and vertically relative to the screen. The screen projection position can be adjusted
          without tilting the entire projector. However, if you try to shift the lens with a projector equipped with
          another type of ultra-short throw lens, the projector itself will interfere with the projected light, making
          it difficult to adjust the screen upwards, as shown in the illustration below.<br>
          Therefore, Epson adopted an ultra-short throw lens with folded optics for its high-lumen projectors. By taking
          advantage of folded optics, Epson minimizes projector interference with the projected light and allows the
          optical axis of the projection lens to be offset in the projector direction.</p>

        <p class="_mt20">A projector with an ultra-short throw lens that has folded optics is advantageous in ceiling
          mounted applications because it easily projects images over the entire wall even in places where the ceiling
          is low. These lenses make it possible to reduce the depth of projectors and dramatically improve projector
          installation and projection freedom. The periscope-like configuration of the lens means projectors can be
          embedded in ceilings, with all but the head of the projection lens largely concealed and unobtrusive.</p>

        <p class="_mt20">Ultra-short throw lenses with folded optics can reduce projector depth and are used not only in
          high-lumen models but also in home projectors.<br>
          Unlike standard projectors, ultra-short throw projectors can be placed near a wall just like a television to
          cast a large screen. A large-diameter aspherical lens is used as the outermost lens to minimize image
          distortion. Good focus performance is achieved over a wide range of projection sizes by using an inner focus
          design.</p>

        <p class="_mt20">Another type of Epson ultra-short throw lens uses a concave mirror. This projection lens
          consists of multiple lenses and a concave aspherical mirror. The concave aspherical mirror reduces image
          distortion and chromatic aberration, which greatly contributes to the realization of ultra-short focal length
          lenses. Furthermore, these projection lenses have fewer and smaller optical components, so they are easier to
          make lighter and thinner, with few protrusions in the thickness direction.</p>
