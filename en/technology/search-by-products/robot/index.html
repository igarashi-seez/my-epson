        <p class="_mt20">Epson, which produced the world's first quartz wristwatch, first developed SCARA robots to
          volume-produce watch movements, which are the sophisticated internal mechanisms that move the hands. We began
          selling SCARA robots in 1983. Over the ensuing 35 years, Epson advanced the speed, accuracy, and usability of
          its robots to enable its customers to automate their own manufacturing processes.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">The volume production of high-quality movements requires speed and accuracy like that possessed
          by skilled workers for long periods of time. Epson sought to satisfy these conflicting demands by refining its
          robot control technology and combining it with sensing technology based on its crystal devices. The result was
          a breakthrough in robot control technology.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">We also sought to improve both speed and accuracy. For example, we increase the degree of
          freedom in equipment design by expanding our control technology to dampen robot-generated vibrations in the
          support base and peripheral equipment.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Manufacturers have long sought robotic solutions to automate tasks that require a human-like
          touch. Modulating the force an end-effector applies to an object, however, is fraught with difficulty.
          Nevertheless, Epson has achieved this by developing force sensors for use in high-precision manufacturing.
          Engineered using Epson's crystal device technology, these sensors can detect minute changes in force and
          rotation despite being resistant to deformation. Epson robots have thus acquired a sense of touch to go along
          with a sense of sight provided by Epson's robotic vision system. These sensory capabilities give our robots
          the potential to solve many issues in manufacturing.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Epson, which has used its crystal device and sensing technologies to drive a wide range of
          innovations, continues to increase the speed, accuracy, and usability of its robots to help customers automate
          their manufacturing processes.</p>

        <div class="heading02">
          <h2>Fulfilling social responsibility with robotics technologies</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">Competition to hire manufacturing workers has intensified largely due to rising income levels
          in emerging economies and aging populations in advanced economies. While manufacturers are increasingly
          looking to automate production, they are facing issues such as lack of space, the difficulty of installation
          and set up, and the difficulty of automating precision processes meaning that they must rely on human
          intervention on the factory floor.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Epson, however, is committed to providing solutions that exceed customer expectations and
          increase productivity by applying its robotics and sensing technologies to create high-speed robots with
          outstanding accuracy.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Epson's force sensors endow robots with the ability to "feel" extremely subtle forces. This
          ability allows them to assemble mating parts, plug in flexible flat cables (FFC), insert capacitors, and
          perform other tasks that demand high accuracy and that have traditionally relied on human sensory perception.
        </p>
        <p class="_mt20">By providing solutions that make automation easy, we are helping manufacturers use robots to
          perform tasks conventionally undertaken by humans. Looking ahead, we will contribute to the development of
          different industries by contributing to automation and manufacturing efficiency.</p>
