          <h2>Achieving High Speed and Accuracy While Preserving Design Flexibility with Vibration Reduction Technology
          </h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">One of the challenges in robot control is vibration. Vibration increases in proportion to the
          operating speed of the robot and can adversely affect the support base and surrounding equipment. Meanwhile,
          manufacturers need to accelerate the speed at which robots move to shorten the time required for each process
          on the manufacturing line.<br>
          Epson developed Vibration Reduction Technology (VRT) to maximize the utility of its own robots. VRT reduces
          vibrations in the support base, end-effector, cameras, and other components by controlling how the robot
          moves. It also minimizes vibration caused by robot movement and enables low-cost, flexible system design.</p>

        <div class="heading02">
          <h2>Challenges for speeding up robots</h2>
        </div>

        <figure class="_center _mt20 _mb30">
          <img src="/en/technology/search-by-products/robot/img/fig_vrt_1.jpg" width="960" height="460"
            alt="Magnitude of vibration">
        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20">Manufacturers want to increase productivity by reducing the time required for each process
          without sacrificing product quality. This requires moving the robot at high speed and with high acceleration.
          However, the faster the robot moves, the greater the vibration it generates and the more residual vibration
          there is after the robot stops. Not only does the robot itself vibrate but also the support base to which the
          robot is secured, and any sensors, cameras, and other devices installed on the robot.<br>
          Even if there is little residual vibration in the robot itself, a large amount of residual vibration in the
          support base would make it difficult to operate the robot at high speed and with good positioning accuracy.
          However, if the robot must wait until the residual vibration subsides to preserve accuracy, the time required
          for each process will increase. Sensor and camera vibration would also increase the possibility of errors in
          detected data, leading to poor product quality.<br>
          Manufacturers need technology that maximizes the performance of the entire manufacturing system by reducing
          vibration in robots and peripheral equipment while maintaining high speeds.</p>

        <div class="heading02">
          <h2>Methods of reducing vibration and related issues</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">The methods below are commonly used to reduce robot vibration and increase robot accuracy.</p>

        <ul class="list-square _mt30">
          <li>Move the robot at low speed and low acceleration.</li>
          <li>Increase the rigidity of the robot arm and reduce the weight of payloads.</li>
          <li>Increase the rigidity of the support base and bolt the robot tightly to it.</li>
          <li>Use cushioning material to prevent vibration from being transmitted to the surrounding</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="_mt20">Slowing down the robot's movements will generate less vibration but make it impossible to
          shorten cycle times. Increasing the rigidity of the robot arm and support base is problematic because it's
          costly and limits locations where robots can be installed.<br>
          When a robot is suspended from a frame, vibration is usually reduced to an acceptable level by using a highly
          rigid, welded iron support base. However, welded support bases with iron frames take time and money to make
          and their height is not adjustable, so they cannot easily be repurposed. An aluminum support base with an
          aluminum frame is easy to make, but aluminum lacks rigidity and the mounts are weak, so it takes time for the
          residual vibration to settle during robot operation. The last method, using cushioning material, is a less
          than ideal option in terms of space efficiency.</p>

          <h2>Advantages of introducing VRT</h2>
        </div>

        <figure class="_center _mt20 _mb30">
          <img src="/en/technology/search-by-products/robot/img/fig_vrt_3.jpg" width="960" height="460" alt="vibration">
        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20">VRT reduces vibrations of the support base, end-effector, cameras, and other components by
          controlling how the robot moves according to the characteristics of these components. This technology is
          especially effective when a robot with large vibration is suspended from a frame. In some cases, it has
          reduced vibration by about 90%.</p>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>Advantages of VRT</h3>
        </div>

        <ul>
          <li class="rounded _bold">Limits robot vibration and enables fast, accurate operation</li>
          <li class="rounded _bold">Helps to reduce cycle time by significantly shortening the time spent waiting for
            residual vibration to subside</li>
          <li class="rounded _bold">Raises productivity by controlling the vibration of all equipment, including the
            support base, while also keeping costs down</li>
          <li class="rounded _bold">Increases the degree of freedom in robot installation and system design while
            eliminating the need to spend a lot of time and money on support base design.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="_center _mt30">VRT, which saves space and enables high speed and accuracy, maximizes the performance
          of Epson robots and contributes to production line productivity.</p>
