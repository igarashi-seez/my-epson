          <h2>Developing the Magic Lever Technology that Underpins Self-winding Wrist Watch</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">Most high-grade watches have a mechanical movement, which uses a mainspring to power the watch.
          Over 60 years ago, Seiko Epson (then Suwa Seikosha but referred to below as Epson), assembled the intellects
          of its engineers to develop a so-called magic lever. This became the fundamental mechanism underpinning
          typical self-winding wrist watches up to the present day. Thereafter, it also triggered a proliferation of
          self-winding wrist watches in Japan. Let's take a look at the original self-winding "magic lever" technology
          that Epson developed.</p>

        <div class="heading02">
          <h2>The inner workings of mechanical watches</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">The mechanism by which a watch operates, known as an engine or movement, can be broadly
          classified into two types: quartz and mechanical. The quartz type uses a battery, so is also referred to as a
          battery type. In contrast, mechanical movements do not use a battery. Energy is stored by winding a
          mainspring, which consists of a metal strip or hair-thin metal strip (wire) in a spiral. The force generated
          when this energy is released operates the watch.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Mechanical watches are classified as either hand-wound or self-winding. As the name suggests,
          the mainspring in a hand-wound watch is wound by turning the crown on the side of the dial. Likewise, the
          mainspring is automatically wound in a self-winding watch. Simply wearing the watch on your wrist or placing
          it on a specialized device that mechanically generates oscillations is needed to wind the mainspring.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">The mechanical movement is equipped with a semicircular oscillating weight about half the size
          of the dial. The motion of the wearer's arm causes this oscillating weight to rotate naturally and
          automatically generate energy. For this reason, self-winding wrist watches are also called "automatic".</p>

          <h2>The history of self-winding technology</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">The origins of self-winding watches date back to the late 18th century. They begin when a Swiss
          watchmaker developed the first self-winding pocket watch. However, the mechanism employed at the time was not
          practical, so it did not come into general use. Nevertheless, the idea began to garner attention again in the
          late 19th century. In 1910, a self-winding wristwatch appeared. Entering the 1920s, a French chronometer
          manufacturer (chronometer refers to a standard for ensuring high quality and precision, as well as the
          products made to this standard) succeeded in creating the world's first self-winding wristwatch. Soon after,
          an English watch engineer succeeded in mass producing self-winding wrist watches.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Then in 1931, a Swiss watchmaker announced a water-resistant self-winding wristwatch, and began
          mass production and sales. Thereafter, watchmakers around the world used this model as reference to develop
          and sell their own self-winding wrist watches. Self-winding wrist watches soon spread widely among the general
          public.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">The development of self-winding wrist watches in Japan trailed watchmakers overseas by more
          than a decade. It began with the announcement of the Seiko Automatic, Japan's first self-winding wristwatch,
          by Daini Seikosha (now Seiko Instruments) in 1956.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">After this, other Japanese watch manufacturers followed Daini Seikosha in announcing
          self-winding wrist watches. But these were all two to three times the cost of the hand-wound watches of the
          day. Epson recognized that cost was an important factor in popularizing self-winding wrist watches, and
          pressed forward with development of a new self-winding wristwatch that could be mass produced.</p>

        <div class="heading02">
          <h2>Developing the original magic lever self-winding technology</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">When development began, the plan was to base it on the mechanism from an existing foreign-made
          self-winding wristwatch. However, when development had progressed to the point of a completed prototype, it
          was discovered that a patent had already been submitted for the technology. Therefore, the same mechanism
          could not be used. The company had to invent its own original self-winding mechanism from scratch. Engineers
          tossed around various ideas, continuing to contemplate and search for the best self-winding wristwatch
          mechanism, from the perspective of dynamics. The result was the invention of an original, cutting-edge, and
          breakthrough self-winding mechanism: the magic lever.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">As noted earlier, the basic principle of self-winding wrist watches is to transmit the energy
          generated by the oscillating weight to the mainspring. To explain in more detail, while the oscillating weight
          rotates in two directions, the mainspring winder only turns in one. Therefore, the question becomes how to
          efficiently transmit energy between these two mechanisms of differing rotations without waste. In response to
          these challenges, our engineers came up with an entirely new and unique winding mechanism. This mechanism
          relies on a small component with pawl-shaped tips called the pawl lever. (This was publicly christened the
          magic lever due to its motion, which was inspired by dynamics and allowed a single part to perform multiple
          functions.) We'll explain a few of the particularly key technologies.</p>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>Key technology 1</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="_bold fsL _mt20 _mb10">Offsetting the central axis of the lever</p>
        <p class="_mt20">The magic lever's axis of motion is purposefully offset slightly from the central axis of the
          oscillating weight. This is done because such a design ensures that the magic lever will move up and down
          regardless of whether the oscillating weight rotates to the right or left. This idea makes it possible for the
          energy generated by the oscillating weight to be efficiently transmitted without waste.</p>

        <div class="heading03">
          <h3>Key technology 2</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="_bold fsL _mt20 _mb10">Different pawl shapes for the left and right</p>
        <div class="photo-massege">
          <div class="text-wrap">
            <p class="_mt20">If you look carefully at the illustration, you can see that the pawl-shaped tips of the
              magic lever differ between right and left. This difference in shape ensures the up and down motion of the
              magic lever is converted to rotation in the same direction, whether the lever rises or falls. This makes
              it possible to turn the transmission wheel and wind the mainspring.<br>
              When the magic lever rises the push pullet pushes the transmission wheel, turning it to the left. At this
              time, the pull pullet slips past the transmission wheel without moving significantly away from it. When
              the magic lever descends, the pull pullet pulls on the transmission wheel, turning it to the left. At this
              time, the push pullet slips past the transmission wheel without moving significantly away from it.<br>
              Because the motion and winding method appear almost as if magic, the mechanism came to be called the magic
              lever. Moreover, since the magic lever itself is made of spring material, it does not come away from the
              gear that winds the mainspring (transmission wheel), even when the pawls do not mesh with the gear teeth,
              or the oscillating weight is not moving.</p>

          <figcaption class="fsS">The Gyro Marvel, which first equipped the magic lever mechanism</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20">The idea and design were set. But the company had no experience in bringing something like this
          to market. There were still various hurdles to overcome. These included improving the overall technology and
          precision, reconsidering materials, and finding new suppliers for these materials. The engineers of the time
          cleared each hurdle, one-by-one, through introducing new machinery and equipment, adding heat treatment to
          prevent deformation, and implementing other solutions.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">To ensure both highly efficient rotation and vibration resistance, both the oscillating weight
          and the ball bearings used in the shaft were re-examined starting from their raw materials. They even
          developed an ultrasmall ball bearing. Various types of oil were newly developed as improvements on the oils
          used in the tenon of the eccentric post, or to optimize the slip torque of the mainspring. The key part in the
          system, the pawl lever, depended on the success of the volume production technology. So the company gathered a
          great number of engineers who worked with pressing to share knowledge and exchange ideas. They hammered out
          details such as the optimal thickness, width, and tip shape, through trial and error.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Thanks to the hard work of these engineers, in 1959 the Gyro Marvel, Epson's first self-winding
          wristwatch equipped with the magic lever, was revealed to the world. This mechanism so dramatically increased
          mainspring winding efficiency, that it spread to become a typical mechanism used in self-winding wrist watches
          thereafter. And it continues to be used in self-winding wrist watches to this day. The price was also held
          down to just slightly higher than hand-wound watches, contributing to its widespread adoption. This also
          triggered the popularization of self-winding wrist watches that followed.</p>

        <p class="_mt60">As we have explained, the Epson engineers of the time overcame many obstacles to make the new
          self-winding mechanism, with its magic lever, a reality. And when they surpassed these challenges, they found
          they had a new technology at their disposal. However, technology is not all that they gained. That is to say,
          watch manufacturing up to that point had generally emulated the style of the Swiss manufacturers. But
          following the development of the magic lever, there was growing momentum to pursue the development methodology
          that had brought forth the development of the magic lever technology. And this kind of momentum gathered steam
          over many years, fomenting the creation of things that had never existed before. This spirit of pursuing
          Creativity and Challenge has been passed down as a part of Epson's DNA to this day.</p>
