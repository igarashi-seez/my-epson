          <h2>Technology Developed for the World's First Quartz Watch</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">Seiko Epson (then Suwa Seikosha but referred to below as Epson) succeeded in developing the
          world's first commercial quartz watch. That was more than half a century ago, in 1969. Today, quartz watches
          account for about 96%<sup>*</sup> of all the watches manufactured globally. The technology developed for the
          first quartz watch continued to evolve and eventually laid the foundations for Epson's crystal device and
          semiconductor businesses. In addition to watches, this technology is found in application as varied as
          computers, digitally controlled home appliances, mobile phones, automobiles, and industrial equipment.<br>
          Read on to learn more about the technology inside the world's first quartz watch.</p>

        <p class="fsS _mt40"><sup>*</sup> The 96% figure was calculated based on a 2017 estimate of watch production
          quantity by the Japan Watch Association.</p>

        <div class="heading02">
          <h2>What are quartz watches?</h2>

            <p class="_mt20">Quartz crystals emit electric signals of a stable frequency under an applied voltage.
              Timepieces that capitalize on this feature to keep accurate time are called quartz watches or clocks.</p>
            <p class="_mt20">Quartz watches first appeared in the late 1960s. They largely replaced the hand-wound and
              self-winding mechanical watches of the day that used a balance spring as a pendulum. Today they are by far
              the most popular type of watch.</p>
            <p class="_mt20">Watches are not the only things that rely on quartz crystals. Quartz crystals are used
              widely to accurately count time or to capture changes in speed and movement, and are therefore found in
              everything from home appliances, PCs, and smartphones to cars and other industrial products.</p>

          <h2>Quartz watch construction</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">The following is a simplified explanation of the operating mechanisms in a quartz watch.<br>
          First, the crystal unit housed in the oscillator 2. oscillates at a frequency of 32,768 Hz on the electricity
          sent from 1. the battery. This frequency is divided by a divider circuit 3. so that it is brought down to one
          signal per second. Furthermore, this signal is converted to mechanical rotary motion by step motor converter
          4., the indicating mechanism 5. moves the hand by one index per second, and this motion is then transmitted to
          the minute and hour hands.</p>

        <p class="_mt20">Quartz clocks became popular from almost the moment they first appeared, but they were less
          than ideal. That was because the crystals needed to be kept at a constant temperature to maintain stable
          frequency output. For this reason, In 1959 early quartz clocks had a thermostatic function that made them very
          large(such as a locker size:1.3m x 2.1m) and increased their power consumption.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Epson thus began research and development work on technology that would reduce the size and
          energy consumption of quartz timepieces without sacrificing accuracy. We replaced the bulky vacuum tubes with
          transistors, got rid of the thermostatic chamber, and developed a temperature compensating device using a
          variable capacitor to realize a much smaller quartz clock. After the company was tasked with developing an
          official timekeeping system for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, the speed of development accelerated. This work
          culminated, in 1963, with the development of a portable quartz clock, the Seiko Crystal Chronometer QC-951.
          Development speed picked up still further, and three years later, in 1966, Epson announced a pocket-sized
          quartz watch. Then, in 1969, we launched the world's first quartz wristwatch, the Seiko Quartz Astron 35SQ.

          <div class="grid8 _mb20">
            <p class="_mt20">Quartz crystals emit an oscillation frequency when a voltage is applied. This
              characteristic led to the development of devices called quartz oscillator units. Conventional quartz
              oscillator units were tubular, but we replaced these with a smaller tuning fork type that saved space and
              oscillated at a stable frequency. However, processing synthetic crystals into a tuning fork shape was a
              challenge because in volume production their fragility made them susceptible to cracking and breaking
              during cutting and polishing. This problem was solved with the invention of a lithographic manufacturing
              process in which hydrofluoric acid is used to etch away the periphery of the crystals. To provide impact
              resistance, we devised a method of suspending the oscillator inside a vacuum capsule, thus enabling volume
              production. Later, the power used by electronic circuits was progressively reduced, and the oscillation
              frequency rose from 8,192 Hz to 32,768 Hz. Today, this frequency is the time standard for most devices
              that use quartz oscillator.</p>

        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20">The electrical signal emitted by a quartz oscillator unit must be divided and the drive
          waveform shaped before it can be converted into mechanical rotational motion. Epson developed a watch IC that
          did just that. This hybrid IC was made possible by some outstanding craftsmen & women who manually soldered 76
          transistors and 84 resistors 29 capacitors total 189 elements onto a ceramic substrate.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">We continued development believing that a stable supply of C-MOS ICs would be essential for
          expanding and stabilizing our wristwatch business. So, we sounded out IC manufacturers. However, the answer
          was always that they couldn't help because there was no demand for ultra-low power devices. That being the
          case, we decided to pursue C-MOS IC development and manufacturing by ourselves. Ultimately, we succeeded in
          developing and volume-producing C-MOS ICs for ultra-low power watches, in 1971.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">These C-MOS IC for watches ran on one-third to one-quarter of the power used by ordinary ICs at
          that time, so, over time, their use expanded beyond watches and into consumer electronics, such as home
          appliances, computers, and cell phones, as well as into automobiles and other devices that support a wide
          range of industries.</p>

          once-per-second rhythm by an IC into mechanical motion that is transmitted through gears to the second,
          minute, and hour hands that we see on the dial. However, conventional cylindrical motors are large and
          difficult to mount in a wristwatch. Therefore, we took on the challenge of developing a new open-type motor,
          one whose parts would be separated and arranged in a dispersed layout. What Epson developed was an
          ultra-compact open-tape step motor consisting of a separate coil, stator, and rotor.<br>
          In addition to the mechanism changes, the new motor had an ultra-fine wire coil, a high magnetic force rotor
          magnet, and an optimized control method for driving the motor. These also resulted in lower power consumption.

          whereas even the most accurate mechanical wristwatches lost or gained about 20 seconds a day, a quartz
          wristwatch, with a daily rate of ±0.2 seconds (and monthly rate of ±5 seconds) was 100 times more accurate.
          The response was such that an article about the Quartz Astron 35SQ even appeared in the New York Times. There
          was also a media story that called the product "a revolution" in the history of horology.
        </p>
        <p class="_mt20">In addition to transformative technology, the Seiko Quartz Astron 35SQ made an impact and
          earned stellar reviews for implementing innovative ideas and for design aesthetics, including a battery cover

        <p class="_mt20">Epson published patents detailing its quartz watch technology. This resulted in the global
          spread of analog quartz watches. Currently, quartz watches account for about 96% of all watches manufactured
          around the world. In other words, Epson's technology gave people in every corner of the Earth access to
          accurate times.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Epson's quartz watch has been the subject of numerous awards, and Epson has earned recognition
          for both the technology and the publication of patents that were opened to the public. And today, even more
          than half a century since its advent, the technology continues to be revered as a beacon of Japanese
          technology.</p>

        <p class="_mt20">Epson went on to further advance key technologies to create products that are even smaller and
          draw less power yet deliver exceptional performance. Epson's crystal devices and semiconductor businesses both
          grew out of quartz watch development. Compactness and power saving were the watchwords that guided development
          work on the quartz watch. These words express ideals to which we still ascribe to this day and which are
          embodied by Epson's efficient, compact, and precision technologies.</p>

        <p class="_mt40 fsS">* The statement that quartz watches account for 96% of all watches manufactured is based on
