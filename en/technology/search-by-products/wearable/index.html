    <p class="_mt20">Epson is what the Swiss call a manufacture, a watchmaker that makes the parts required for its products in its own production facilities. We have long accumulated design, development, and manufacturing technologies in the creation of such watches as mechanical, quartz, and spring drive with quartz accuracy. In addition, we craft our own cases, dials, hands, and other external parts and capitalize on the Epson Group's semiconductor, crystal oscillator, and ultra-precision processing technologies. We draw on a rich storehouse of technological assets to create original analog watches that others do not offer.</p>
