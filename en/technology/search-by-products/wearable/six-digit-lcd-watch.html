          <h2>Technology that Enabled the World's First Six-Digit LCD Digital Watch</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">Liquid crystal displays are now used in digital watches, smartphones, televisions and a host of
          other products. Nearly 50 years ago, Seiko Epson Corporation (Suwa Seikosha at the time but referred to
          hereafter as Epson) was among the first companies to see the promise of practical applications for liquid
          crystal technology and began research and development. This R&D effort culminated in the release of the
          world's first digital wristwatch equipped with a six-digit field-effect liquid crystal display (FE LCD).</p>

        <p class="_mt20">Epson succeeded in developing the world's first analog quartz watch, in 1969. While analog
          watches, with hands that tick off the time, had their supporters, the global tide was shifting toward digital
          watches, which display numbers, and digital watch research and development gained momentum around the world.
          Epson rode this tide and began developing fully electronic digital watches while concurrently developing
          quartz watches.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">The difference between an analog watch and a fully electronic digital watch is that the latter
          lacks a mechanical drive mechanism. Everything up to the vibration of the crystal unit that counts the time
          and the electronic circuit that shapes the emitted waves is the same in both types of watch. However, fully
          electronic watches do not have a stepping motor beyond the electronic circuit as analog quartz watches do.
          Instead, they are designed to send an electric signal directly to the liquid crystal display panel to display
          the time.</p>

            <p class="_mt20">The world's first digital wristwatch was announced in 1970 by an American company. However,
              that watch used an LED display, which left room for improvement in terms of readability and power
              consumption. Epson therefore set out to develop a different type of digital watch.</p>

        <p class="_mt20">Epson turned its attention to liquid crystals, which were beginning to attract attention as
          display elements that could be electronically controlled. Epson initially considered dynamic scattering mode
          (DSM) liquid crystal as a potential display candidate but eventually concluded that customers would benefit
          more from an FE LCD because of its high visibility and low power consumption. Epson launched R&D on FE LCDs in
          1968 and took on a series of challenging technical issues, including the synthesis and encapsulation of liquid
          crystal, electrode structures, operating temperature range, panel display contrast conditions, and volume
          production.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">An LCD is produced by encapsulating liquid crystal molecules between a pair of glass substrates
          equipped with a polarizing filter and electrodes. Text and images are displayed by controlling the switching
          of voltages and controlling the amount of light transmitted through the polarizers. In an FE LCD, alignment
          layers are disposed on either side of the liquid crystal layer. The alignment layers have grooves that run in
          a fixed direction. The liquid crystal molecules sandwiched between these layers align themselves along the
          grooves. So, when one of the alignment layers is rotated 90 degrees from the other, the liquid crystal
          molecules twist 90 degrees. Light that travels along the liquid crystal molecules will also twist 90 degrees
          so that it passes through the gaps in the second polarizer. Liquid crystal molecules also realign when a
          voltage is applied. Under a voltage, the molecules align vertically so that the light travels straight,
          without twisting, until it reaches the second polarizer, which blocks it.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Epson used these features of FE LCDs to independently develop the ideal display for digital
          watches. Feeding this development were the efficient, compact, and precision technologies that Epson nurtured
          in the manufacture and development of mechanical watches. These included technologies and skills for precision
          processing, shrinking the geometries of electronic circuits, and accomplishing volume production.</p>

          <h2>The Seiko Quartz LC V.F.A. 06 LC,<br>
            the world's first six-digit LCD digital wristwatch</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">In October 1973, Epson (at that time, Suwa Seikosha) released the fully electronic Seiko Quartz
          LC V.F.A. 06LC, a digital watch that displayed the time on an FE LCD rather than on a dial with hands. The LCD
          display showed six digits, two each for the hour, minutes, and seconds.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">The watch looks digital, but the source of the time-keeping vibrations is a crystal oscillator
          like that used in quartz watches. The watch thus maintained excellent accuracy and, thanks to reduced power
          consumption, could run for two years on the same battery. In addition, users could individually adjust the
          hour and minutes with the simple push of a button.</p>

        <div class="heading02">
          <h2>Projectors, smart glasses, and other products derived from LCDs</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="_mt20">In addition to the LCD, the 06LC was equipped with a lamp. Customers around the world raved
          about the contrast of the display and the clarity of the numbers. As a result, LCDs became the display of
          choice for digital watches developed after the 06LC.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Meanwhile, Epson was conducting parallel development work on applications other than digital
          watches. Before using them in contemporary products such as 3LCD projectors and smart glasses, Epson was using
          LCDs in products such as TV watches (1982), mobile phones (1993), and pocket-sized color TVs (1984).</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Epson's FE liquid crystal technology has been developed and become widely adopted as
          twisted-nematic (TN) liquid crystal. It is used by Epson and many other electronics manufacturers as a core
          technology for liquid crystal displays and many other products.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">In 2019, the technology related to the development of the world's first six-digit LCD digital
          wristwatch was recognized along with subsequent achievements by the National Museum of Nature and Science as
          one of the Essential Historical Materials for Science and Technology.</p>
