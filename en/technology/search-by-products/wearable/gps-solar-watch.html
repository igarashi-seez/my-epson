            <p class="_mt20">Seiko Epson Corporation (Suwa Seikosha at the time but referred to hereafter as Epson)
              developed what is widely accepted to be the world's first quartz watch, the Quartz Astron 35SQ, in 1969.
              Mechanical watches had a daily rate (the amount of time a watch gains or loses over a 24-hour period) of a
              dozen seconds or more. Quartz watches revolutionized watches by bringing an entirely new level of
              accuracy-a daily rate of just ± 0.2 seconds.<br>
              In 2012, 43 years after the development of the Quartz Astron, Epson again brought a revolution by
              developing the 7X series, the world's first GPS solar watches.</p>

        <p class="_mt20">The radio signals used by ordinary radio-controlled watches are time calibration signals
          transmitted from terrestrial transmission stations. These time calibration signals have a service area that is
          limited to the areas around transmission stations in several locations in Japan and around the world. Epson
          wanted to provide radio-controlled watches that keep accurate time anywhere in the world and therefore turned
          its attention to the development of a global positioning system (GPS) as the solution.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">The U.S. has a constellation of GPS satellites that fly at an altitude of about 20,000 km. The
          satellites are arranged in six orbital planes, four in each orbit, and have an inclination angle of 55
          degrees. Each satellite circles the Earth twice a day. There are about 30 GPS satellites in total, but the
          number in operation at any one time varies depending on spares and maintenance. The U.S. is committed to
          keeping 24 of them available at all times. Since multiple GPS satellites can always be seen regardless of
          where you are on Earth, a GPS watch can receive information from multiple GPS satellites and use triangulation
          to calculate your current position (latitude and longitude).<br>
          GPS satellites are equipped with cesium and rubidium atomic clocks that have an error of less than 1 second
          per 100,000 years, which is higher than the accuracy of crystal oscillators used in quartz watches. They
          constantly transmit time information synchronized with UTC (Coordinate Universal Time).<br>
          GPS was first developed for military use by the US Department of Defense in the 1970s, but in the 1990s it was
          opened to the world for civilian use. Epson's GPS solar watches capture GPS signals from these satellites to
          maintain accurate position and time data.</p>

        <div class="heading02">
          <h2>Rapidly determining time zones around the world</h2>
        </div>

        <figure class="_center _mt20 _mb30">
          <img class="_w70" src="/en/technology/search-by-products/wearable/img/img_timezone.jpg" width="840"
            height="471" alt="timezone">
        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20">In the latter half of the 19th century, the concept of time zones came about. Since the Earth
          rotates 15 degrees longitudinally every hour, it was divided into 15 time zones (360 degrees / 24 hours = 15
          degrees). However, over time, governments have set their own time zones, and in 2012, when Epson's first GPS
          solar watch was developed, there were 39 time zones. To accurately determine the time in each region, it is
          necessary to automatically determine not only the latitude and longitude but also the time zone. Epson's GPS
          solar watches automatically determine this, enabling them to display the accurate time anywhere in the world.
        </p>
        <p class="_mt20">GPS watch users can capture position information and correct the time zone in as little as 30
          seconds with a simple operation. On the other hand, in daily life where one does not change time zones, the
          watch determines whether signals can be received without user intervention. So, as long as there is signal
          reception, the watch automatically receives only time information. It takes as little as six seconds to
          maintain the accurate time.</p>

        <div class="heading02">
          <h2>Development of a new antenna to receive weak GPS signals</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="photo-massege">
          <div class="text-wrap">
            <p class="_mt20">GPS signals are very weak because they are sent from GPS satellites some 20,000 km above
              Earth. Epson thus needed to develop an extremely sensitive antenna to capture these signals. The antenna
              we developed is ring-shaped and sandwiched between the movement, which is encased in metal, and the glass.
              It is installed such that it follows the outer circumference of the dial. The antenna is covered with a
              bezel and dial ring made of non-conductive materials that allow radio waves to pass. This design gives the
              antenna wide directivity and high sensitivity to radio waves from the direction of the dial.</p>
            <p class="_mt20">The watch reliably catches signals and keeps accurate time almost anywhere in the world and
              even in urban canyons, where buildings interfere with GPS signal reception, and even when the wearer is on
              the move. The antenna pairs functionality with aesthetics as a watch.</p>

          <h2>Development of a low-power GPS module that runs solely on light energy</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="photo-massege">
          <div class="text-wrap">
            <p class="_mt20">Solar watches obtain power by converting the light energy from the sun and indoor lighting
              into electrical energy. Epson's GPS solar watches are powered exclusively by light energy, so a system for
              stably and continuously supplying the energy obtained from light was needed. Epson maximized the power
              generating area by arranging the solar cell under the dial and secured the energy required for GPS
              functions by converting the light that enters the dial into electrical energy that is stored in a
              secondary battery. This photovoltaic system is what powers the watch.</p>

          <figcaption class="fsS">GPS modules</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20">Epson began developing GPS modules in 1996 and took on the challenge of developing new
          technology, such as GPS signal processing technology, for them. One of the goals from the very outset was to
          develop and apply GPS technology to watches. As a result, Epson ended up engineering a GPS module that
          operates on about one-fifth the power of conventional GPS modules used for mobile phones. This unique
          technology lowered power consumption to the point where Epson's GPS solar watches can run exclusively on light
          energy.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">Of course, developing this technology was no easy task. GPS signals contain a lot of
          information that requires a lot of energy to process. The pride that the developers of the GPS solar watch
          took in creating a watch that processes this information yet runs exclusively on light energy is a mindset
          that Epson engineers have consistently demonstrated over decades.</p>

        <div class="heading02">
          <h2>Further evolution achieved lower power consumption,
            a smaller size, and improved usability</h2>
        </div>

        <figure class="_center _mt20 _mb30">

          <figcaption class="fsS">Transition of miniaturization</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p class="_mt20">GPS solar watches continue to evolve. The first-generation 7X series, developed in 2012, was
          followed by the 8X series, in 2014. The 8X series featured an improved GPS module. It consumed significantly
          less power and could be charged with about half as much light as a 7X series watch. It also sported a
          beautiful dial, with an improved texture and excellent light transmittance. In addition, every part of the
          movement was meticulously analyzed to save space. The result was a watch head that was about 30% smaller and
          had a sleeker, more refined look.</p>
        <p class="_mt20">The 5X series, developed in 2018, is Epson's third generation of GPS solar watches. We focused
          on advances in terms of both size and design. The outer diameter of the 5X series is smaller than that of the
          8X series, but the area of the dial is wider, providing better visibility. Power consumption was further
          reduced. The 5X series consumes about 1/4 the amount of power consumed by the first-generation 7X series and
          about half that of the 8X series. The satellite search capabilities were improved by developing entirely new
          parts related to reception performance. Time correction, which took at least six seconds on the first
          generation, takes as little as three seconds on the latest generation.<br>
          The 3X series, developed in 2019, is a smaller, more comfortable size for women. It has a simple design and
          good usability.<br>
          In addition, all Epson GPS solar watches since the 8X series are compatible with Michibiki, Japan's
          quasi-zenith satellite system, and achieve an even higher rate of reception success in Japan.</p>

        <p class="_mt20">The GPS solar watch was selected to receive the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science
          and Technology Award at the 2016 Kanto Region Invention Awards sponsored by the Japan Institute of Invention
          and Innovation in recognition of Epson's commitment to the relentless pursuit of groundbreaking technology and
          to advancing performance and accuracy.</p>
